{"original_topic": "adolescence", "comment": "Need advice about a boy at my school Hi,\n\nI\u2019m a 14-year-old girl, and I\u2019m new at my school. For a while now, I\u2019ve noticed that a boy in my class behaves in a certain way towards me, and I\u2019m not sure how to interpret it. Here are the facts:\n\n1. **At the beginning of the school year**, he often tried to make eye contact with me. I\u2019m very shy, so I avoided it. Then, he started calling me *Baka* (a Japanese word for \"idiot\") discreetly, but I could clearly hear him.\n2. **As time went on, his behavior changed**. During a school trip, on the bus, he suddenly said: *\"Wesh \\[my name\\], how are you!?\"* Then, he kept looking at me. Every time I looked at him, he would look away, and when I turned back to the window, he would look at me again. This went on for a while until I got too embarrassed and turned completely away.\n3. **One day in class**, I was talking to his little sister (we\u2019ve become friends) a bit away from the group. When we decided to rejoin the others, he suddenly rushed towards my friend, stopped abruptly when he saw me, and then went back to his friends.\n4. **His little sister told me things about him**. She said he talked about me at home, saying that at the beginning of the year, he had certain thoughts about me, but now it\u2019s better. He also said that I was nice and that I didn\u2019t talk to boys, which made me a \"good Muslim.\" He asked her not to tell me, but of course, she did.\n5. **One day, he asked if I was Moroccan**. I replied a bit curtly (I regret it). My friend later told me that before I arrived, he was talking to his friend about wanting to focus on his projects, but as soon as I walked in, he asked me that question.\n6. **Recently, while I was handing out papers in class**, he suddenly turned towards me and whispered something to his friend.\n7. **Another time, he asked me:** *\"Are you going to defend me at the class council?\"* (I\u2019m just an eco-delegate and not involved in the class council). Right after asking, he left without waiting for an answer.\n\nI\u2019m confused. He seems comfortable talking to other girls, but with me, he acts distant and ambiguous. Do you think he might be interested in me, or am I reading too much into this? How should I react?\n\nThank you in advance for your advice!\n\nAsk me questions if some points are not clear :)", "timestamp": 1763758907, "label": "0"}

{"original_topic": "breaking_bad", "comment": "Jesse is not a victim This is something I've been wanting to talk about for a while now, so here goes. I honestly don't understand the whole victimization of Jesse in this show. I agree he suffered some horrible stuff throughout the show, but let's not pretend Jesse's not screwed up so many situations. He led Hank to the RV, he got high with Jane which caused Walt to miss his child's birth, he spent Walt's money on hookers when it was supposed to be spent for buying an RV, and the stupidest of all, attempting to kill the two drug dealers. I can go on and on about this. He is not innocent! This is contradictory to a comment I made on an earlier post, where I stated that he had a stronger moral compass, but that doesn't mean he's a good guy lol. At the end of the day, the guy is a murderer, a guy who tried to sell meth to recovering addicts, and a guy who cooked meth. Simple as.", "timestamp": 1763758908, "label": "0"}

The worst things that fell on his conscience were the ones he didn't do.\n\nIt shows how he completely lost control of the consequences of his actions.

Honestly I don\u2019t think my interpretation is beyond surface level because I\u2019m pretty sure anybody more developed than me could already see it for what it is lol but it\u2019s just so amazing that do these two not only kill someone back to back (episode wise) but both parties have opposite reactions to it. Walt has to save Jesse\u2019s life and basically doesn\u2019t hesitate once he realizes what needs to be done (I think personally at the dinner scene before leaving you can see he was visibly angry, if anything just as angry as Jesse was) and kills without a SECOND thought. Next episode Jesse has to kill Gale but unlike Walt, as soon as the realization comes to the surface there\u2019s not only extreme hesistance but it\u2019s for a good moral reason; Gale is still innocent so there *has* to be another solution, right (as opposed to Jesse\u2019s firm stance that the dealers needed to die for what they were doing and ended up doing in the end)? Jesse does end up doing what he has to do, but you can see the man\u2019s actually tore up about and I suppose if we want to take it further than these two episodes Walt has no remorse for Gale while Jesse does but they both have no remorse for the dealers that got killed.\n\nAlso side note, it\u2019s sort of unrelated, but sometimes I think of how in season 1 episode 3 when they knew what had to be done to Krazy-8, Walt was very hesitant on doing so &amp; was crying at the end like Jesse while Jesse was very insistent (to be fair though, the coin flip **is** sacred).\n\nI really like this show.", "timestamp": 1763758908, "label": "1"}

Jesse goes to retaliate, believing Walt wouldn't care or react or even know about it until Jesse had already gone to the dealers. They were already waiting for him, Jesse gets gunned down and Gus consoles Walt after having the dealers killed by Mike for killing Tomas and causing the situation to begin with. Now Gus has Walt, his perfect lab and no more \"junkie\". Walt knew this, he figured it out and literally told Gus that hypothetically Jesse might have believed it was Gus' doing. The show writers wouldn't have Walt say this unless they wanted us to think about it. \n\nBut does that make Walt the good guy? Or Mike? No. Mike wanted to kill Jesse for a long time. He wanted to kill Jesse just for doing drugs after his girlfriend died. Literally told Walt, \"Let me take care of it\" intending to kill Jesse at a drug house when he was consumed with grief. The same Mike that we're supposed to believe saw Jesse as a son. \n\nOn the flip side, Mike figured Walt out and knew exactly what kind of man Walt was. Walt isn't a saint. He kept Jesse alive for his own selfish reasons. He used Jesse, manipulated him, took advantage of him. And let's not forget... Walt caused Jane to turn over and choke and then stood there while she choked. Walt is also the reason they got mixed up with Gus to begin with. \n\nHere's the list of garbage moves Walt made that caused Jesse's life to get progressively worse at every turn: \n\n1. When they were making cash hand over fist, Walt freaked out about Skinny Pete getting mugged which is absolutely a thing that dealers have to deal with. This put Jesse in a compromising situation for a wad of cash that they could easily make back on the back end. No retaliation is bad for business? You can retaliate in other ways. Black list those \"customers\" and they'll find a way to pay you back. Like Jesse said, they had the best product and no one else was dealing because Tuco was dead. \n\n2. After Jesse gets caught up in a situation that leads to a man's death, he starts getting cocky and pushes for them to expand. He tries to act like a know it all, pulling out a map and *teaching* Jesse, the one who is in charge of business, new areas to expand to. Jesse literally warns him that going into new territory will lead to violent encounters but Walt is happy to milk the MISBELIEF that Jesse killed Spooge even though he knows Jesse and his crew are no killers. At this point, they don't even have junior dealers working for Badger, Skinny Pete or Combo. \n\n3. Every single thing that Jesse warned Walt about happens. First, Badger gets arrested which costs them $80k to resolve. This also loses them a dealer. And then, disaster: Combo gets killed. Where? In new territory where Gus' dealers are. This means they're down two dealers and only have Skinny Pete. And he naturally wants out because Combo is dead. This also puts Jesse under tremendous stress which leads to him leaning heavily into drugs. Walt starts worrying about how they're going to sell 50 pounds of product, but he doesn't seem AT ALL worried about Jesse. He finagles a deal with a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy and manages to get a deal to sell all of his product to Gus. At this point, there's no doubt that Gus is most likely buying it just to get it off the market. \n\nThe entire reason they end up in business with Gus, the entire reason Combo was killed by Gus' dealers, the entire reason this whole business deal with Gus even starts is due to **WALT'S EGO**. His ego is also what led to them having their run-in with Tuco. Walt was angry about $1500-$2000 a day being too slow for him and wanted to sell to a distributor. Walt was angry about needing pseudo for a traditional cook so he concocted the plan to steal methylamine. Out of everyone, Gus and Walt are the only ones who didn't want to \"get out\" of the business. \n\nMike was a lot of things, and up until he finally warmed up to Jesse, he was a piece of shit in a lot of ways, but he wasn't in the business to be in the business. He was happy to get out ahead at various points in the series. Him and Jesse were willing to walk away, sell their shares of the methylamine and walk away with more money than they could've earned in a lifetime. But who wanted to stay? Walt. \n\nIt's easy to see Walt as the reasonable one who wanted to help Jesse. But it's important to understand that almost every time Walt \"saved\" Jesse, he was saving Jesse from a horrible situation that **he himself** put Jesse in.", "timestamp": 1763758913, "label": "0"}

I'm not really a huge tv person nor do I usually give into the hype of things but a few months ago I was looking up \"best television series of all time\" and of course Breaking Bad was consistently mentioned as being #1. I'm so happy I finally got around to watching the series, I'm just sad that I'm so late. The entire cast was phenomenal, every episode from the very first one pulled me into and kept me surprised, entertained and yet astonished at how beautifully it was shot.

{"original_topic": "wednesday", "comment": "I really wish Tyler and the other Hydes were written more like actual Jekyll-and-Hyde monsters Basically, exactly what the title says. A lot of the writing in this show is\u2026 let\u2019s call it \u201cwonky,\u201d and the show's lore suffers from it. The Alpha werewolf lore feels like it was made up in 5 minutes, and the Hyde lore isn\u2019t much better. The show dedicated two seasons to Hydes, and it still feels all over the place.\n\nHydes are clearly inspired by Robert Louis Stevenson's novella *The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde*. In the novella, Dr. Henry Jekyll develops a potion to separate his good and evil sides. When he drinks it, he transforms into evil Edward Hyde. Over time, Jekyll's transformations become more frequent and involuntary. The novella ends with Jekyll's final, unchangeable transformation into Hyde, who then commits suicide.\u00a0Throughout the story, Jekyll remembers everything he does as Hyde. Hyde is not a separate personality that takes over Jekyll's consciousness; rather, Hyde is Jekyll acting without his usual inhibitions, and Jekyll is fully aware of Hyde's actions. Essentially,\u00a0Jekyll tries to use the transformation to indulge in his darker impulses.\n\nThat\u2019s a very cool concept. And in Season 1, it seemed like the show was going in that direction. Tyler\u2019s first transformations are triggered by Laurel\u2019s chemicals. Maybe not at first, but over time, he becomes fully aware of his actions as a Hyde and starts enjoying them, because they give him the freedom to act on impulses he normally suppresses. That tracks with the original novella. But then the show adds lore that honestly makes everything messier: the **\u201cmaster\u201d**.\n\nAt first, I get it; writers needed a way to justify Laurel controlling Tyler and tie the twist together. Fine. But Season 2 introduces Tyler\u2019s mother, and suddenly the whole \u201cmaster\u201d concept becomes a narrative roadblock. So now apparently female Hydes don\u2019t need a master, only male Hydes do. BUT the master\u2019s control seems optional because Tyler kills Laurel and fights his own mother, AND male Hydes supposedly go \u201cinsane\u201d without a master, AND they still die young because each transformation shortens their lifespan. It really sucks being a male hyena. I mean Hyde.\n\nSo\u2026 what does a \u201cmaster\u201d even mean anymore?\n\nIt just feels *messy.* I wish they had stuck closer to the original Jekyll-and-Hyde idea rather than constantly adding plot-convenient rules that contradict earlier ones. And it\u2019s not just Hydes. The Alpha werewolf lore is equally vague and inconsistent.\n\nSeason 3 is going to expand the Hyde/werewolf lore even more with Capri and her mix of Hydes and werewolves, and honestly? I\u2019m scared that by the end of it, things are going to be even more convoluted than they already are, when they really don\u2019t need to be.\n\nAlso, as I was finishing typing all of this, I remembered that in Season 1, Xavier had some weird psychic connection to Tyler/Hyde, which the show never explained. But I guess we\u2019re never going to learn how or why that worked. Oh well\u2026\n\nJust some of my thoughts. What do you guys think about Hydes and how the show handles their lore?", "timestamp": 1763758919, "label": "1"}

{"original_topic": "wednesday", "comment": "Why Wenclair Doesn\u2019t Click for Me Anymore- as a huge fan of the ship after s1 I\u2019ve been trying really hard to figure out why Wenclair doesn\u2019t hit for me anymore, especially because I *want* to love them the way I did back in season one. I genuinely enjoyed their dynamic at first. Their contrast felt natural, their growth felt earned, and the whole \u201cOpessites attract\u201d trope actually worked really well. They had softness, tension, vulnerability, and all these tiny moments that made their connection feel warm and meaningful. I really believed in the version of them that season one was building.\n\nBut after S1, something changed for me, and it\u2019s been harder than I expected to reconnect with the ship. In season two, the relationship that hooked me just\u2026 wasn\u2019t there in the same way. They spent a lot of their scenes either arguing, miscommunicating, or being emotionally out of sync, and I never felt like the show gave them the time to rebuild or deepen the connection they started with. Even when they *did* have an emotional moment, like right before switching their bodies back, it didn\u2019t carry that same spark or weight from S1. It felt more like a leftover of what they used to be rather than a continuation of what they could\u2019ve become.\n\nI\u2019m not saying the writing was malicious or that the characters stopped caring about each other, but the shift in their dynamic made it harder for me to see the romantic potential that used to stand out so clearly. Instead of growing closer, it felt like they drifted apart, and the emotional thread between them got thinner instead of stronger. And when a ship relies heavily on chemistry, softness, and contrast, that shift really affects how you connect with it.\n\nI also want to be clear: this isn\u2019t an attack on Wenclair or the people who love it. I completely understand why the ship is meaningful to so many fans, and I think the version of Wenclair in season one was genuinely compelling. I\u2019m not trying to take that away from anyone. I\u2019m just being honest about my own experience: after S1, the show didn\u2019t give me the same feeling or energy that originally made me see their relationship in a romantic light.\n\nThe frustrating part is that I *wish* I still shipped it. I wish I could recapture that spark I felt the first time around. I wish I could go back to seeing what everyone else still sees. But the shift in how they were written in S2 changed the way I interpreted their dynamic, and no matter how much I try to get that old feeling back, I can\u2019t force it.\n\nSo this isn\u2019t a hate post, or a dismissal, or some superiority compex thing. It\u2019s just me admitting that the version of Wenclair I connected to isn\u2019t really present anymore, at least not for me.

{"original_topic": "euphoria", "comment": "Euphoria really destroyed its potential Hey y\u2019all, so I was bored and decided to rewatch Euphoria, and dang guys season 1 is literally so peak. I really feel like Euphoria stands out from all these other high school dramas because the aesthetic and cinematography is just beautiful, not to mention that I also feel like the characters are super realistic (not so much the whole high school aspect because every one of these bitches would be dress coded in two seconds if it was the real world lol) but just the way the characters think and feel, I mean I\u2019m in college now but when season 1 first came out, I was a sophomore in high school and the characters were just so relatable to me.\n\nBut I\u2019m not gonna lie, Euphoria really just wasted away all of its potential with season 2 and how they\u2019re treating the release of season 3. First of all, season 2 was lowkey trash. There wasn\u2019t much in the way of character development or just overall storyline, and after rewatching season 2, it really just feels kind of dragged on. When the hype was going on for season 2, people treated this show like it could do no wrong and so did I, but now I really just feel like season 2 is pretty bad. Lexi\u2019s play was also so unnecessary, like I get that they were trying to show how she was coming out of her shell and stuff, but I feel like they could have done that in a much better way, we as the audience really didn\u2019t need a whole recap of the events of season 1 in a school play that would have never been allowed to exist in a real school. Outside of just the writing though, I mean these people have waited SO LONG to release the next season, it\u2019s gonna be 4 years by the time the new season comes out. I know there were unexpected deaths from the cast which is just a tragedy, but it\u2019s been so long and there\u2019s so many people missing in the show now that I feel like people aren\u2019t even excited about this show anymore, and they should lowkey just call it good, but of course they\u2019re gonna milk it financially for all that it\u2019s worth. It just kind of sucks because season 1 had the potential to make the show the best modern teen drama ever made, yet it failed so miserably.", "timestamp": 1763758923, "label": "0"}

{"original_topic": "peaky_blinders", "comment": "I miss the grounded and realistic tone that the early seasons had I\u2019ve rewatched the entire show many times at this point and the more often I do, the more often I find myself gravitating towards the earlier seasons. I think there\u2019s something about them where the characters just feel more \u201creal\u201d and the dramatic stakes feel more relatable overall.\n\n\nWhen you analyze it, the first two seasons are about an illegitimate businessman trying to raise both himself and his dysfunctional family through the criminal underworld of the early 20th century. Their goal is to simply survive in this society.\n\n\nIn Season Three, the focus becomes more worldly and grand in scale. Tommy begins doing secret diplomatic missions for the British intelligence service and international diplomatic relations are at play. The Season Three finale ends with a large action set piece involving a train chase and explosives. Contrast that with the previous two finales where main characters simply get shot.\n\n\nAlso before people inevitably start accusing me of \u201chating on\u201d the later seasons. No, I don\u2019t hate them. I enjoy the later seasons, especially Season Three and Five. I think they both do a great job of telling a political narrative while keeping the tone grounded and suspenseful. The finale of Season Five is so simple and yet grips with tension.\n\n\nWith the movie coming out soon and the story of it once again involving Tommy doing secret agent James Bond esque missions for Churchill in the middle of a World War. I can\u2019t help but hope that they don\u2019t forget about the smaller character moments. Peaky Blinders is at its best when it focuses on the individual, real world emotional drama of its characters. And it can be easy to lose that when the stakes are so grand.", "timestamp": 1763758924, "label": "1"}

I didn\u2019t give enough appreciation to her character the first time around. Her character development is really quite fascinating to watch. Starting out as a communist to widow to political advisor and major entity in the Shelby company. She is strong willed, intelligent, and not afraid of Tommy which I love. She is also super kind and loving to her family and the men she deals with. Despite not always being directly involved in every episode the actress always nails her performances. Her character is essential but sometimes unassuming. \n\nThis thought really came about because I\u2019m watching the interactions between her and Lady Diana and it\u2019s incredible to watch. She is witty and sarcastic enough to keep up with the \u201cdigs\u201d from Diana. But still remains loyal to her roots.

Some say it's Vecna, others say that it's the Mindlflayer controlling Vecna.\nFor me it's clearly Vecna, we know that Henry entered a strange dimension when Eleven \"killed\" him, the Mindflayer was already there but it was Henry who shaped him (therefore connecting himself to the hive mind and gaining control of the creatures there) and the dimension into the world he desired. So it's ultimately Vecna the one who controls everything that happens in the Upside Down, including the actions of the Mindflayer in season 3.\nThe way I view it, the Mindlfayer is a tool for Vecna to use, not an independent creature (maybe it is but it's manipulated by Henry who knows).\n\nI'm interested in what the people that think it's the other way around have to say!", "timestamp": 1763758928, "label": "1"}

{"original_topic": "stranger_things", "comment": "This dynamic is all I really wanna see from season 5. All over The net all I've seen is \"Byler\" this \"Mileven\" that.... \n\n\nBut what I'm most hopeful to see is these two finally interacting in a significant way. And to see if their relationship has at all grown.\n\n\nOf all the dynamics between characters missed opportunities etc The fact that Of everyone of the characters these two have barely shared any screentime or significant meaningful moments together is one I find the most baffling.\n\n\nEl risked her life to save Will Byers multiple times. Sensed him in the Upside Down. And did everything she could to reunite him with his friends and family. \n\n\nIn season 2 she states to Joyce she saw his suffering from the Mind flayers possession and closed the Gate saving his life and freeing him. \n\n\nAfter all that you would think these two would strike up some kind of friendship. Or meaningful dynamic. However the two barely interact. Even after Hopper's disappeareance and El's subsequent Adoption by Joyce. \n\n\nThe two go to school together, seem to get along for the most part but still no real sign of significant development in their Relationship. (Not even taking into account Will's feelings for Mike, as one could argue it's a contributing factor in Will seemingly being distant from El) \n\nWill does seem to feel bad for El experiencing bullying and offer to help fix her project. \n\n\nHowever afterwards there's some tension between them over Mike's visit. Again we aren't focusing on that.\n\n It's only after El is taken by Brenner that I think we begin to see Will really step up &amp; take some initiative to find her apart from Mike. Notably doing what he can to reassure Mike the whole time &amp; Straight up calling her Family and his sister even when \"Johnathan addresses her as \"Step sister \".\n\n\nIn these moments &amp; upon reuniting with El we finally see El and Will have a significant emotionally charged interaction. As they hug and Will tearfully asked if she was ok clearly relieved to see her. \n\n\nWill also is instrumental in motivating Mike to speak from his Heart to save her from Vecna. Another moment where Will stepped up for El. (Putting his own feelings aside for her safety in these moments may be his way of returning the favor )\n\nSo more than anything else next season I need to see this dynamic become more fleshed out. I think it's  long overdue that These two characters given everything they've been through together really feel like they've reached a point where they truly have become close friends who Have each other's backs. Will maybe even  thanking  El for Saving him before.\n\n\n\nI also think it's time for Will to step up this season and get angry if you know what I mean. The Mind flayer, Vecna, and The Upside-down has ruined his entire life and hurt everyone he cares about. It's time he was the one to fight back and say \"Enough\"! \n\n\nBut what do you guys think? Do you guys wanna see Will and El become closer in season 5?", "timestamp": 1763758929, "label": "1"}

I\u2019m also open to recs of other great later episodes that stand on their own, though given the time restraints I would need to be picky to weed out the lesser stuff from the great ones. \n\nAlso, one last thing; it sucks that Netflix is losing the show.  But there may be a tiny sliver of hope in that it\u2019s been reported that Netflix is privately in communication with the owners of Warner Bros, which is up for sale.   They are interested in purchasing WB, but at this current stage they\u2019re just feeling out their options versus other potential buyers to see if it\u2019s feasible not only for themselves but for WB seller.

For a while now, I\u2019ve noticed that a boy in my class behaves in a certain way towards me, and I\u2019m not sure how to interpret it. Here are the facts:\n\n1. **At the beginning of the school year**, he often tried to make eye contact with me. I\u2019m very shy, so I avoided it. Then, he started calling me *Baka* (a Japanese word for \"idiot\") discreetly, but I could clearly hear him.\n2. **As time went on, his behavior changed**. During a school trip, on the bus, he suddenly said: *\"Wesh \\[my name\\], how are you!?\"* Then, he kept looking at me. Every time I looked at him, he would look away, and when I turned back to the window, he would look at me again. This went on for a while until I got too embarrassed and turned completely away.\n3. **One day in class**, I was talking to his little sister (we\u2019ve become friends) a bit away from the group. When we decided to rejoin the others, he suddenly rushed towards my friend, stopped abruptly when he saw me, and then went back to his friends.\n4. **His little sister told me things about him**. She said he talked about me at home, saying that at the beginning of the year, he had certain thoughts about me, but now it\u2019s better. He also said that I was nice and that I didn\u2019t talk to boys, which made me a \"good Muslim.\" He asked her not to tell me, but of course, she did.\n5. **One day, he asked if I was Moroccan**. I replied a bit curtly (I regret it). My friend later told me that before I arrived, he was talking to his friend about wanting to focus on his projects, but as soon as I walked in, he asked me that question.\n6. **Recently, while I was handing out papers in class**, he suddenly turned towards me and whispered something to his friend.\n7. **Another time, he asked me:** *\"Are you going to defend me at the class council?\"* (I\u2019m just an eco-delegate and not involved in the class council). Right after asking, he left without waiting for an answer.\n\nI\u2019m confused. He seems comfortable talking to other girls, but with me, he acts distant and ambiguous. Do you think he might be interested in me, or am I reading too much into this? How should I react?\n\nThank you in advance for your advice!\n\nAsk me questions if some points are not clear :)", "timestamp": 1763759583, "label": "0"}

I honestly don't understand the whole victimization of Jesse in this show. I agree he suffered some horrible stuff throughout the show, but let's not pretend Jesse's not screwed up so many situations. He led Hank to the RV, he got high with Jane which caused Walt to miss his child's birth, he spent Walt's money on hookers when it was supposed to be spent for buying an RV, and the stupidest of all, attempting to kill the two drug dealers. I can go on and on about this. He is not innocent! This is contradictory to a comment I made on an earlier post, where I stated that he had a stronger moral compass, but that doesn't mean he's a good guy lol. At the end of the day, the guy is a murderer, a guy who tried to sell meth to recovering addicts, and a guy who cooked meth. Simple as.", "timestamp": 1763759585, "label": "0"}

Walt has to save Jesse\u2019s life and basically doesn\u2019t hesitate once he realizes what needs to be done (I think personally at the dinner scene before leaving you can see he was visibly angry, if anything just as angry as Jesse was) and kills without a SECOND thought. Next episode Jesse has to kill Gale but unlike Walt, as soon as the realization comes to the surface there\u2019s not only extreme hesistance but it\u2019s for a good moral reason; Gale is still innocent so there *has* to be another solution, right (as opposed to Jesse\u2019s firm stance that the dealers needed to die for what they were doing and ended up doing in the end)? Jesse does end up doing what he has to do, but you can see the man\u2019s actually tore up about and I suppose if we want to take it further than these two episodes Walt has no remorse for Gale while Jesse does but they both have no remorse for the dealers that got killed.\n\nAlso side note, it\u2019s sort of unrelated, but sometimes I think of how in season 1 episode 3 when they knew what had to be done to Krazy-8, Walt was very hesitant on doing so &amp; was crying at the end like Jesse while Jesse was very insistent (to be fair though, the coin flip **is** sacred).\n\nI really like this show.", "timestamp": 1763759585, "label": "1"}

I actually don't disagree with everything said about Mike's \"points\". I agree with a lot of it. \n\nI think Gus had Tomas murdered or at least knew that's what the dealers would do. Think about it. Gus' big thing is that his people don't operate without his consent or knowledge. Gus liked these dealers so much, he risked his relationship with Walt to protect them. There's no way they did that without Gus having at least mild knowledge of it. I think it was a play to get Jesse killed. Jesse goes to retaliate, believing Walt wouldn't care or react or even know about it until Jesse had already gone to the dealers. They were already waiting for him, Jesse gets gunned down and Gus consoles Walt after having the dealers killed by Mike for killing Tomas and causing the situation to begin with. Now Gus has Walt, his perfect lab and no more \"junkie\". Walt knew this, he figured it out and literally told Gus that hypothetically Jesse might have believed it was Gus' doing. The show writers wouldn't have Walt say this unless they wanted us to think about it. \n\nBut does that make Walt the good guy? Or Mike? No. Mike wanted to kill Jesse for a long time. He wanted to kill Jesse just for doing drugs after his girlfriend died. Literally told Walt, \"Let me take care of it\" intending to kill Jesse at a drug house when he was consumed with grief. The same Mike that we're supposed to believe saw Jesse as a son. \n\nOn the flip side, Mike figured Walt out and knew exactly what kind of man Walt was. Walt isn't a saint. He kept Jesse alive for his own selfish reasons. He used Jesse, manipulated him, took advantage of him. And let's not forget... Walt caused Jane to turn over and choke and then stood there while she choked. Walt is also the reason they got mixed up with Gus to begin with. \n\nHere's the list of garbage moves Walt made that caused Jesse's life to get progressively worse at every turn: \n\n1. When they were making cash hand over fist, Walt freaked out about Skinny Pete getting mugged which is absolutely a thing that dealers have to deal with. This put Jesse in a compromising situation for a wad of cash that they could easily make back on the back end. No retaliation is bad for business? You can retaliate in other ways. Black list those \"customers\" and they'll find a way to pay you back. Like Jesse said, they had the best product and no one else was dealing because Tuco was dead. \n\n2. After Jesse gets caught up in a situation that leads to a man's death, he starts getting cocky and pushes for them to expand. He tries to act like a know it all, pulling out a map and *teaching* Jesse, the one who is in charge of business, new areas to expand to. Jesse literally warns him that going into new territory will lead to violent encounters but Walt is happy to milk the MISBELIEF that Jesse killed Spooge even though he knows Jesse and his crew are no killers. At this point, they don't even have junior dealers working for Badger, Skinny Pete or Combo. \n\n3. Every single thing that Jesse warned Walt about happens. First, Badger gets arrested which costs them $80k to resolve. This also loses them a dealer. And then, disaster: Combo gets killed. Where? In new territory where Gus' dealers are. This means they're down two dealers and only have Skinny Pete. And he naturally wants out because Combo is dead. This also puts Jesse under tremendous stress which leads to him leaning heavily into drugs. Walt starts worrying about how they're going to sell 50 pounds of product, but he doesn't seem AT ALL worried about Jesse. He finagles a deal with a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy and manages to get a deal to sell all of his product to Gus. At this point, there's no doubt that Gus is most likely buying it just to get it off the market. \n\nThe entire reason they end up in business with Gus, the entire reason Combo was killed by Gus' dealers, the entire reason this whole business deal with Gus even starts is due to **WALT'S EGO**. His ego is also what led to them having their run-in with Tuco. Walt was angry about $1500-$2000 a day being too slow for him and wanted to sell to a distributor. Walt was angry about needing pseudo for a traditional cook so he concocted the plan to steal methylamine. Out of everyone, Gus and Walt are the only ones who didn't want to \"get out\" of the business. \n\nMike was a lot of things, and up until he finally warmed up to Jesse, he was a piece of shit in a lot of ways, but he wasn't in the business to be in the business. He was happy to get out ahead at various points in the series. Him and Jesse were willing to walk away, sell their shares of the methylamine and walk away with more money than they could've earned in a lifetime. But who wanted to stay? Walt. \n\nIt's easy to see Walt as the reasonable one who wanted to help Jesse. But it's important to understand that almost every time Walt \"saved\" Jesse, he was saving Jesse from a horrible situation that **he himself** put Jesse in.", "timestamp": 1763759590, "label": "0"}

I'm not really a huge tv person nor do I usually give into the hype of things but a few months ago I was looking up \"best television series of all time\" and of course Breaking Bad was consistently mentioned as being #1. I'm so happy I finally got around to watching the series, I'm just sad that I'm so late.

{"original_topic": "wednesday", "comment": "I really wish Tyler and the other Hydes were written more like actual Jekyll-and-Hyde monsters Basically, exactly what the title says. A lot of the writing in this show is\u2026 let\u2019s call it \u201cwonky,\u201d and the show's lore suffers from it. The Alpha werewolf lore feels like it was made up in 5 minutes, and the Hyde lore isn\u2019t much better. The show dedicated two seasons to Hydes, and it still feels all over the place.\n\nHydes are clearly inspired by Robert Louis Stevenson's novella *The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde*. In the novella, Dr. Henry Jekyll develops a potion to separate his good and evil sides. When he drinks it, he transforms into evil Edward Hyde. Over time, Jekyll's transformations become more frequent and involuntary. The novella ends with Jekyll's final, unchangeable transformation into Hyde, who then commits suicide.\u00a0Throughout the story, Jekyll remembers everything he does as Hyde. Hyde is not a separate personality that takes over Jekyll's consciousness; rather, Hyde is Jekyll acting without his usual inhibitions, and Jekyll is fully aware of Hyde's actions. Essentially,\u00a0Jekyll tries to use the transformation to indulge in his darker impulses.\n\nThat\u2019s a very cool concept. And in Season 1, it seemed like the show was going in that direction. Tyler\u2019s first transformations are triggered by Laurel\u2019s chemicals. Maybe not at first, but over time, he becomes fully aware of his actions as a Hyde and starts enjoying them, because they give him the freedom to act on impulses he normally suppresses. That tracks with the original novella. But then the show adds lore that honestly makes everything messier: the **\u201cmaster\u201d**.\n\nAt first, I get it; writers needed a way to justify Laurel controlling Tyler and tie the twist together. Fine. But Season 2 introduces Tyler\u2019s mother, and suddenly the whole \u201cmaster\u201d concept becomes a narrative roadblock. So now apparently female Hydes don\u2019t need a master, only male Hydes do. BUT the master\u2019s control seems optional because Tyler kills Laurel and fights his own mother, AND male Hydes supposedly go \u201cinsane\u201d without a master, AND they still die young because each transformation shortens their lifespan. It really sucks being a male hyena. I mean Hyde.\n\nSo\u2026 what does a \u201cmaster\u201d even mean anymore?\n\nIt just feels *messy.* I wish they had stuck closer to the original Jekyll-and-Hyde idea rather than constantly adding plot-convenient rules that contradict earlier ones. And it\u2019s not just Hydes. The Alpha werewolf lore is equally vague and inconsistent.\n\nSeason 3 is going to expand the Hyde/werewolf lore even more with Capri and her mix of Hydes and werewolves, and honestly? I\u2019m scared that by the end of it, things are going to be even more convoluted than they already are, when they really don\u2019t need to be.\n\nAlso, as I was finishing typing all of this, I remembered that in Season 1, Xavier had some weird psychic connection to Tyler/Hyde, which the show never explained. But I guess we\u2019re never going to learn how or why that worked. Oh well\u2026\n\nJust some of my thoughts. What do you guys think about Hydes and how the show handles their lore?", "timestamp": 1763759596, "label": "1"}

{"original_topic": "wednesday", "comment": "Why Wenclair Doesn\u2019t Click for Me Anymore- as a huge fan of the ship after s1 I\u2019ve been trying really hard to figure out why Wenclair doesn\u2019t hit for me anymore, especially because I *want* to love them the way I did back in season one. I genuinely enjoyed their dynamic at first. Their contrast felt natural, their growth felt earned, and the whole \u201cOpessites attract\u201d trope actually worked really well. They had softness, tension, vulnerability, and all these tiny moments that made their connection feel warm and meaningful. I really believed in the version of them that season one was building.\n\nBut after S1, something changed for me, and it\u2019s been harder than I expected to reconnect with the ship. In season two, the relationship that hooked me just\u2026 wasn\u2019t there in the same way. They spent a lot of their scenes either arguing, miscommunicating, or being emotionally out of sync, and I never felt like the show gave them the time to rebuild or deepen the connection they started with. Even when they *did* have an emotional moment, like right before switching their bodies back, it didn\u2019t carry that same spark or weight from S1. It felt more like a leftover of what they used to be rather than a continuation of what they could\u2019ve become.\n\nI\u2019m not saying the writing was malicious or that the characters stopped caring about each other, but the shift in their dynamic made it harder for me to see the romantic potential that used to stand out so clearly. Instead of growing closer, it felt like they drifted apart, and the emotional thread between them got thinner instead of stronger. And when a ship relies heavily on chemistry, softness, and contrast, that shift really affects how you connect with it.\n\nI also want to be clear: this isn\u2019t an attack on Wenclair or the people who love it. I completely understand why the ship is meaningful to so many fans, and I think the version of Wenclair in season one was genuinely compelling. I\u2019m not trying to take that away from anyone. I\u2019m just being honest about my own experience: after S1, the show didn\u2019t give me the same feeling or energy that originally made me see their relationship in a romantic light.\n\nThe frustrating part is that I *wish* I still shipped it. I wish I could recapture that spark I felt the first time around. I wish I could go back to seeing what everyone else still sees. But the shift in how they were written in S2 changed the way I interpreted their dynamic, and no matter how much I try to get that old feeling back, I can\u2019t force it.\n\nSo this isn\u2019t a hate post, or a dismissal, or some superiority compex thing. It\u2019s just me admitting that the version of Wenclair I connected to isn\u2019t really present anymore, at least not for me. And I really wish that wasn\u2019t the case.", "timestamp": 1763759598, "label": "1"}

Their goal is to simply survive in this society.\n\n\nIn Season Three, the focus becomes more worldly and grand in scale. Tommy begins doing secret diplomatic missions for the British intelligence service and international diplomatic relations are at play. The Season Three finale ends with a large action set piece involving a train chase and explosives. Contrast that with the previous two finales where main characters simply get shot.\n\n\nAlso before people inevitably start accusing me of \u201chating on\u201d the later seasons. No, I don\u2019t hate them. I enjoy the later seasons, especially Season Three and Five. I think they both do a great job of telling a political narrative while keeping the tone grounded and suspenseful. The finale of Season Five is so simple and yet grips with tension.\n\n\nWith the movie coming out soon and the story of it once again involving Tommy doing secret agent James Bond esque missions for Churchill in the middle of a World War. I can\u2019t help but hope that they don\u2019t forget about the smaller character moments. Peaky Blinders is at its best when it focuses on the individual, real world emotional drama of its characters. And it can be easy to lose that when the stakes are so grand.", "timestamp": 1763759598, "label": "1"}
{"original_topic": "peaky_blinders", "comment": "Ada is underrated I\u2019m watching the series for the second time. And I\u2019ve finally gotten to season 6 and I have to say Ada is written so well. I didn\u2019t give enough appreciation to her character the first time around. Her character development is really quite fascinating to watch. Starting out as a communist to widow to political advisor and major entity in the Shelby company. She is strong willed, intelligent, and not afraid of Tommy which I love. She is also super kind and loving to her family and the men she deals with. Despite not always being directly involved in every episode the actress always nails her performances. Her character is essential but sometimes unassuming. \n\nThis thought really came about because I\u2019m watching the interactions between her and Lady Diana and it\u2019s incredible to watch. She is witty and sarcastic enough to keep up with the \u201cdigs\u201d from Diana. But still remains loyal to her roots. I love that she dresses so well and is threatening without ever doing too much.  I just have to give my props to this character and the actress. So well done.", "timestamp": 1763759599, "label": "1"}

{"original_topic": "euphoria", "comment": "Euphoria really destroyed its potential Hey y\u2019all, so I was bored and decided to rewatch Euphoria, and dang guys season 1 is literally so peak. I really feel like Euphoria stands out from all these other high school dramas because the aesthetic and cinematography is just beautiful, not to mention that I also feel like the characters are super realistic (not so much the whole high school aspect because every one of these bitches would be dress coded in two seconds if it was the real world lol) but just the way the characters think and feel, I mean I\u2019m in college now but when season 1 first came out, I was a sophomore in high school and the characters were just so relatable to me.\n\nBut I\u2019m not gonna lie, Euphoria really just wasted away all of its potential with season 2 and how they\u2019re treating the release of season 3. First of all, season 2 was lowkey trash. There wasn\u2019t much in the way of character development or just overall storyline, and after rewatching season 2, it really just feels kind of dragged on. When the hype was going on for season 2, people treated this show like it could do no wrong and so did I, but now I really just feel like season 2 is pretty bad. Lexi\u2019s play was also so unnecessary, like I get that they were trying to show how she was coming out of her shell and stuff, but I feel like they could have done that in a much better way, we as the audience really didn\u2019t need a whole recap of the events of season 1 in a school play that would have never been allowed to exist in a real school. Outside of just the writing though, I mean these people have waited SO LONG to release the next season, it\u2019s gonna be 4 years by the time the new season comes out. I know there were unexpected deaths from the cast which is just a tragedy, but it\u2019s been so long and there\u2019s so many people missing in the show now that I feel like people aren\u2019t even excited about this show anymore, and they should lowkey just call it good, but of course they\u2019re gonna milk it financially for all that it\u2019s worth.

He has proven this time and time again. He let alt-Michael into himself, I think, because he was desperate to save Sam and Jack. But he had to know that the angel was not going to honor the deal and would take him over. Besides Castiel, they haven't had a whole lot of great experiences with angels. He seemed so surprised when Michael did what he did and I was just like, really? What did he expect? That Michael would just quietly leave at the end of that terrible fight (that fight being a discussion for another time). Lucifer is dead (maybe, who knows, the next seasons are all new for me), Dean is gone (I know he gets out of it because I hope they wouldn't beat this dead horse of a plotline for two more seasons), Jack is graceless and Sam is alone again. This series has had some high and lows but I feel like this finale was maybe the worst so far.", "timestamp": 1763759608, "label": "0"}

So I think most of you are aware that the show is scheduled to leave Netflix altogether in roughly a month.  \n\nI am running through the series, but I started about three months ago and am currently at the midway point of season 9.  What I want to ask you guys is, I won\u2019t be able to finish the series in the time left mostly because I have a life and would need to watch multiple hours per day to finish it.  But I have heard about two episodes that not only sound super interesting, but also get great IMDb ratings that I\u2019m really interested in watching:  \u201cScoobynatural\u201c and \u201cBaby.\u201d  Can I watch those right now, or at least very soon, and not be spoiling anything?  In other words, will I be able to watch it and enjoy/understand it without first burning through the series from where I am now?\n\nI appreciate the advice while avoiding spoilers from post season 9.   I\u2019m also open to recs of other great later episodes that stand on their own, though given the time restraints I would need to be picky to weed out the lesser stuff from the great ones. \n\nAlso, one last thing; it sucks that Netflix is losing the show.  But there may be a tiny sliver of hope in that it\u2019s been reported that Netflix is privately in communication with the owners of Warner Bros, which is up for sale.   They are interested in purchasing WB, but at this current stage they\u2019re just feeling out their options versus other potential buyers to see if it\u2019s feasible not only for themselves but for WB seller.  And of course, if they can purchase WB they would be outright getting the rights for Supernatural amongst their entire vast catalogue.  It probably won\u2019t happen soon, but it could still happen.  Something to keep an eye on.\n\nI appreciate any comments about the two episodes referenced, cheers.  \u270c\ufe0f", "timestamp": 1763759608, "label": "0"}

This is season 5 episode 12 \"Swap Meat\" where this teenage boy basically used his abilities to switch bodies with Sam. I get this was supposed to be some unusual thing they haven't really experienced before, but the amount of times throughout this show when Sam's own body gets taken advantage of or violated is very unsettling. There's this episode, Azazel feeding demon blood to six-month old Sam, the woman in white basically force-kissing and abusing Sam in the pilot, Meg possessing Sam in S2E14, Ruby exploiting him with demon blood in season 4, the two hunters literally forcing demon blood down Sam's throat while physically restraining him in S5E3, that whole Becky plot in S7E8, and more. Why did the writers have Sam being constantly violated and taken advantage of and being the bigger punching bag and using them for laughs and humor?

Time doesn\u2019t move there. The whole world is \u201cstuck.\u201d\n\nAnd strangely enough, this reminds me of a moment in *A Wrinkle in Time* where Mrs. Whatsit explains how you can \u201cwrinkle\u201d space and time\u2014literally folding a dimension so two faraway points suddenly touch. When a dimension gets bent or torn the wrong way, a slice of reality can get trapped outside the normal flow of time.\n\nIn *Wrinkle*, a misstep in higher-dimensional travel can freeze time, collapse a world, or trap someone in the wrong dimension.\n\nThat\u2019s basically what happens in Hawkins.\n\nWhen Eleven touches the Demogorgon during the sensory-deprivation experiment in 1983, it doesn\u2019t just open a gate\u2014it tears the fabric of spacetime itself. The Upside Down becomes a *frozen moment* in Hawkins history, like a page ripped out of a book and stuck on repeat. A literal \u201cwrinkle in time.\u201d\n\nIt's a broken timeline, trapped in the moment the tear was made.\n\nThe metaphors line up:\n\n* *A Wrinkle in Time*: a dimensional fold that collapses time\n* *Stranger Things*: a dimensional tear that freezes time\n* The Upside Down: a world suspended in a single day\n\nThe more I think about it, the more it feels like the Upside Down isn\u2019t just parallel\u2014it\u2019s stuck in November 6, 1983, because the original breach ripped a hole in the flow of time itself.\n\nKind of wild how two completely different stories end up saying the same thing about higher dimensions and broken timelines.", "timestamp": 1763759609, "label": "0"}

I want to pose a question as i've seen people with different opinions argue about this topic and i'm curious.\nSPOILERS: i want to make sure i don't ruin the fun for anyone so if you haven't watched season 4 don't continue reading.\n\nWho would you think is the king/leader/thinking mind of the Upside Down?? Some say it's Vecna, others say that it's the Mindlflayer controlling Vecna.\nFor me it's clearly Vecna, we know that Henry entered a strange dimension when Eleven \"killed\" him, the Mindflayer was already there but it was Henry who shaped him (therefore connecting himself to the hive mind and gaining control of the creatures there) and the dimension into the world he desired. So it's ultimately Vecna the one who controls everything that happens in the Upside Down, including the actions of the Mindflayer in season 3.\nThe way I view it, the Mindlfayer is a tool for Vecna to use, not an independent creature (maybe it is but it's manipulated by Henry who knows).\n\nI'm interested in what the people that think it's the other way around have to say!", "timestamp": 1763759611, "label": "1"}

{"original_topic": "stranger_things", "comment": "This dynamic is all I really wanna see from season 5. All over The net all I've seen is \"Byler\" this \"Mileven\" that.... \n\n\nBut what I'm most hopeful to see is these two finally interacting in a significant way. And to see if their relationship has at all grown.\n\n\nOf all the dynamics between characters missed opportunities etc The fact that Of everyone of the characters these two have barely shared any screentime or significant meaningful moments together is one I find the most baffling.\n\n\nEl risked her life to save Will Byers multiple times. Sensed him in the Upside Down. And did everything she could to reunite him with his friends and family. \n\n\nIn season 2 she states to Joyce she saw his suffering from the Mind flayers possession and closed the Gate saving his life and freeing him. \n\n\nAfter all that you would think these two would strike up some kind of friendship. Or meaningful dynamic. However the two barely interact. Even after Hopper's disappeareance and El's subsequent Adoption by Joyce. \n\n\nThe two go to school together, seem to get along for the most part but still no real sign of significant development in their Relationship. (Not even taking into account Will's feelings for Mike, as one could argue it's a contributing factor in Will seemingly being distant from El) \n\nWill does seem to feel bad for El experiencing bullying and offer to help fix her project. \n\n\nHowever afterwards there's some tension between them over Mike's visit. Again we aren't focusing on that.\n\n It's only after El is taken by Brenner that I think we begin to see Will really step up &amp; take some initiative to find her apart from Mike. Notably doing what he can to reassure Mike the whole time &amp; Straight up calling her Family and his sister even when \"Johnathan addresses her as \"Step sister \".\n\n\nIn these moments &amp; upon reuniting with El we finally see El and Will have a significant emotionally charged interaction. As they hug and Will tearfully asked if she was ok clearly relieved to see her. \n\n\nWill also is instrumental in motivating Mike to speak from his Heart to save her from Vecna. Another moment where Will stepped up for El. (Putting his own feelings aside for her safety in these moments may be his way of returning the favor )\n\nSo more than anything else next season I need to see this dynamic become more fleshed out. I think it's  long overdue that These two characters given everything they've been through together really feel like they've reached a point where they truly have become close friends who Have each other's backs. Will maybe even  thanking  El for Saving him before.\n\n\n\nI also think it's time for Will to step up this season and get angry if you know what I mean. The Mind flayer, Vecna, and The Upside-down has ruined his entire life and hurt everyone he cares about. It's time he was the one to fight back and say \"Enough\"! \n\n\nBut what do you guys think? Do you guys wanna see Will and El become closer in season 5?", "timestamp": 1763759612, "label": "1"}
