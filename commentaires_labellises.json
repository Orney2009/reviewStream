Zero second of fillers and the storyline is just so packed and well paced. \n\nThe show had this perfect balance of mystery, horror, thrill and heart back then. Season 1 feels like lightning in a bottle. Small town, small cast and one central mission, find Will. The world hadn't exploded into ten different storylines yet, the tension stayed insane. \n\nThe scale being small did wonders. One missing kid. One group of boys. One grieving mom. One girl with powers. One shady lab. That\u2019s it. And somehow it felt massive because the stakes were so personal.\n\nNo matter how big the show gets, that first season is always going to feel like lightning in a bottle. It set the tone perfectly. And this is why Season 2 is my 2nd favourite Season, it had the essence of Season 1. \n\nSeason 2 is the closest the show ever got to recapturing that formula. It felt like Hawkins wasn\u2019t drowning in plot threads unlike the later seasons. The characters were dealing with the fallout of Season 1, everyone was still connected, the tone stayed grounded, and Will\u2019s possession arc was just so damn strong.", "timestamp": 1763736224, "label": "1"}

Dustin, steve, and joy were my favorites.  Some negatives for me were how they gave no storyline for Jonathan in later seasons, he was my favorite and was glad he ended up with Nancy but  at the end of season 4 I kind of wanted Nancy to break up and get back with Steve. Eddie was one of the best characters added at the end while I coudnt really say the same about argyles character, I can totally see why they didn't invite him back as his characters tone and vibe wouldn't clash well for the final season.

{"original_topic": "stranger_things", "comment": "Anyone else really dislike Hopper? He\u2019s so toxic. \n\nEleven went through unimaginable trauma. She was treated like a lab rat for her entire life growing up, didn\u2019t have family, just experiments they did on her. She couldn\u2019t even interact regularly with others when she first escaped. She was then hunted by the lab as she experienced the first time what it\u2019s like being a human around others who aren\u2019t abusing her.\n\nEnter Hopper, her next abuser.\n\nHe essentially lures her and traps her in his house for over a year, not letting her leave, by scaring her so much. She went from a physical prison in the lab to a mental prison with Hopper. The only people she ever had any relationship with, just a few miles away, yet she can\u2019t see them or interact with them. Until she herself finally got the courage to rebel and break free from the mental prison he put her in. And he did this cause it made him feel good about losing his own daughter. He used her like a prop for his own soothing, all while talking to her and treating her like trash.\n\nAfter she finds out her mom is brain dead stuck in a recurring nightmare, and has no family left, Eleven finally reunited with Mike and the gang only because they found out she was alive. If it was for hopper to decide he would\u2019ve kept her mentally locked up in that house forever. She only now gets to leave because Hopper\u2019s cover is blown and he can\u2019t entrap her any more. \n\nThen when she starts forming the first real relationships in her life, and has Mike as her BF, Hopper is so toxic that he can\u2019t just let her be. Even Joyce tries to explain to him it\u2019s ok for her and Mike to be with each other like that. But Hopper can\u2019t stand to have her out of his control so much so that he gloats in literally threatening and bullying a child to stay away from Eleven and to further isolate her from others. There was no reason to do that. Literally none. He just couldn\u2019t stand that the relationship existed so for his own pleasure he destroyed it to further isolate her.\n\nHis abuse isn\u2019t as apparent as it should be. I\u2019m sure many people watching this show are saying \u201che\u2019s an overall good guy though.\u201d That\u2019s only cause he\u2019s taken on a cop savior role as his profession. To be clear, he\u2019s so useless as a cop that he himself doesn\u2019t figure things out. It\u2019s usually the kids or someone else figuring it out and he just provides man power to help assist. So he\u2019s not even that good at his job really. But his role and the little support he does give to main characters gives him an appearance of legitimacy and like he\u2019s a good guy and not an actual abuser to Eleven. \n\nHe also uses circumstances to hide his abuse. Like Eleven being hunted or needing to keep her identity hidden. That might be true but it doesn\u2019t require isolating her from others so much and treating her like trash while she\u2019s there. He goes way overboard on that because it helps him with his own trauma. \n\nThe saddest part is that Eleven has been abused so long in her life that, like Stockholm syndrome, she sees him as a good guy. The same way she saw Papa as good and built a bond with him when he abused her at the lab. \n\nWhen I thought Hopper died at the end of season 3, I thought wow he finally got a just end. Finally he\u2019s out of the show. Only for him to come back season 4 and find a way to waste screen time by being in a Russian prison and a side quest for Joyce that could\u2019ve been cut from the show without much impact. \n\nThis is one of the worst characters in the show. Even the way he smokes cigarettes and looks like his face is dirty all the time with unkept hair like he hasn\u2019t showered in a week and is out of shape cause he doesn\u2019t take care of himself. He has little to no redeeming qualities. \n\nI\u2019m not saying the guy is doing the abusing on purpose. I\u2019m saying he\u2019s so toxic that he\u2019s an abuser and he himself doesn\u2019t even realize it. Eleven doesn\u2019t either from Stockholm syndrome. And others aren\u2019t close enough to him and his relationship to Eleven to even know.", "timestamp": 1763736224, "label": "0"}
{"original_topic": "stranger_things", "comment": "my death predictions for the last season! Hey! I\u2019ve been thinking about the last season a lot as it approaches, and after watching some prediction videos about who might die in this last act of the show I decided to share my own thoughts! Even though I\u2019m the kind of person who loves when shows aren\u2019t afraid to kill off characters, Stranger Things has been proving time and time again that it\u2019s not that kind of story. So even if I long for a bigger kill count to raise the stakes, I genuinely don\u2019t think many characters are at risk of dying. Having said so, let me break my thoughts down for you! \n\nFirstly, I think Erica is completely safe! It\u2019s a bold affirmation to make, saying someone has zero percent chances of dying, but I can\u2019t see a reason for why they would kill her off. She doesn\u2019t seem to be involved in Lucas or Dustin\u2019s plot lines this season, and since they\u2019re the only two characters who have an emotional connection to her, her death wouldn\u2019t really be emotionally satisfying with anyone else around\u2026 she might join Lucas\u2019 storyline at some point, but I really can\u2019t see them killing her off because Lucas\u2019 main focus this season will be protecting Max. Killing his sister, while an interesting possibility for his arc, would probably make him too distraught to focus on anything else. Besides that, I also just genuinely don\u2019t think there\u2019s a way to make her death be satisfying. While killing a younger kid like her would show how horrifying the whole situation is, Erica is just far too removed from the other characters and the plot itself. Killing her off would make an impact too big for a character with so little relevance like her, if that makes sense? I just don\u2019t think the writers are willing to give her that much importance, she\u2019s not that central to the narrative and the story wouldn\u2019t benefit from it.\n\nFor the original party, the only one I can imagine them killing off is Will but I also don\u2019t think the writers will go there. I have conflicting thoughts about Will: while I would love for him to die in a \u201cit started with him, it has to end with him too\u201d way, I also think that it\u2019s an ending too dark for what the writers want their story to be. One could argue that killing Will would make the story feel unsatisfying because \u201cwhy would they go through so much to save him only for him to die in the end\u201d, and while I don\u2019t completely agree (mainly because I love tragic stories), I kinda can\u2019t argue against it. Will dying would completely break Joyce, and I just can\u2019t see a way for her to bounce back from that. I can\u2019t imagine a happy ending \u2014 which is what the writers seem to want to write \u2014 for her if Will dies, so I\u2019m pretty sure he survives. The other three boys are even less likely to die: Lucas is probably the most likely to be killed off out of the three, but I just can\u2019t picture him dying before Max wakes up and I can\u2019t imagine her having a happy ending with him dead (so unless Max also dies, Lucas is kinda safe on my book); Dustin sacrificing himself for the others wouldn\u2019t be a bad ending per se, but it would kinda make Eddie\u2019s sacrifice feel pointless, and I just don\u2019t think it would be a good move to kill character who used to be so cheery and heart-warming in the season where they\u2019re having an arc about dealing badly with someone\u2019s death (and also there are just too many people willing to sacrifice themselves for him); finally, Mike would be a super interesting choice for a death, but I can\u2019t imagine them killing him off. Mike needs to be there for the emotional impact of Eleven and Will\u2019s character arcs, whatever their endings may be, so he\u2019s also safe in my book. Also, I just can\u2019t imagine a happy ending for the Wheelers if he dies.\n\nSimilarly, I just can\u2019t picture a happy ending for them if Holly dies. She\u2019s having a more important role in the season, and judging from the leaks it would be kinda pointless to have her going on a side quest with Henry Creel/Vecna if she ends up dying in the end. The Wheelers (Mike and Nancy particularly, maybe Karen too if she isn\u2019t incapacitated the whole season) will go out of their way to save Holly after her disappearance, I doubt the writers would write that plot line only for it to end in the most unsatisfying end of all: Holly dying. I won\u2019t completely rule it out because it could be pulled off, but I seriously doubt they want to go with that route. \n\nSimilarly to Mike, I can\u2019t fathom a reality where Joyce isn\u2019t present in the final showdown to raise the emotional stakes for Eleven and Will. Her death would be bittersweet since her goal from day one was to protect her son from danger, and it wouldn\u2019t be completely unsatisfying if written correctly, but I just can\u2019t imagine it. I don\u2019t know if her children or Hopper would be able to bounce back from her death, and I feel like I don\u2019t even need to imagine it because she has very low chances of dying. I just can\u2019t see it, genuinely. Hopper is in a very similar place but slightly more likely to die because he doesn\u2019t have as many close connections (in that level) as Joyce, but they already did a fake-out with him so\u2026 I just feel like it would be cheap to repeat it. Eleven losing him twice would be devastating, and Joyce too after already having lost Bob. It\u2019s just really unlikely, I don\u2019t think he dies. \n\nAbout Max, I don\u2019t see a reason for them to keep her alive if they were going to kill her off in the next season. Again, killing a character after a fake-out feels cheap, especially when said character\u2019s death wouldn\u2019t align with the show\u2019s intended happy finale. Having Max go through so much just for her to die would be devastating, it would feel pointless and would give an awful message that no matter how hard you (a character who has been kicked down by life time and time again) fight, you can\u2019t escape the misery you lived in\u2026 I could accept her death in season four despite this, but the fake-out just makes it feel even more cruel. Why give her another chance only to rip it away again?\n\nThis is how I feel about Eleven as well. Her death would also give that impression, but my main problem isn\u2019t even that: I could see her dying if it didn\u2019t hurt Hopper\u2019s arc directly. Make him lose his daughter twice? He wouldn\u2019t bounce back. At most, I can see her sacrificing herself in a different way (maybe staying in the Upside Down, even if it\u2019s still unsatisfying) or just leaving Hawkins at the end of the story, but I don\u2019t know\u2026 she could go either way but I\u2019m leaning towards her survival as well. I won\u2019t be super shocked if she dies but I still believe she will survive in some way, however that way may be. \n\nMoving on to the teens, I think that Nancy and Jonathan will have the happy ending they deserve which means they will end up together living happily ever after. The one I can imagine dying the most is Jonathan because his arc has always been about taking care of others, but I just don\u2019t think Nancy or the Byers could achieve a truly happy ending if he were to die, and the same with Jonathan and the Wheelers for Nancy. They are too central for each other\u2026 I could see them dying but I just genuinely don\u2019t think the writers will do that, even if they did do a major disservice to Jonathan\u2019s character arc in the previous two seasons (not necessarily about him doing drugs, but just generally making him irrelevant). \n\nAbout Robin, I am kinda fearful for her future but as time goes on I\u2019m more certain of her survival\u2026 it just seems weird to kill her off after making her love interest (Vicky) more relevant. I do think there may be a somewhat good way to pull her death off, but I kinda just don\u2019t see them doing it? I won\u2019t completely rule it out, but the \u201cbury your gays\u201d trope just doesn\u2019t seem like something the writers might want to touch upon\u2026 but I don\u2019t know! Maybe her and Vicky having a relationship is a way for Robin\u2019s character to feel more fulfilled before killing her off? Maybe they\u2019ll kill Vicky before her? Even though I was initially concerned about her, I will stick to her survival. I do think it could go either way! \n\nOut of the main cast (I don\u2019t think of Murray or Vecna as main cast), Steve is definitely the most likely to die. Yes, he\u2019s been predicted to sacrifice himself for a long time now, but I do think there are some chances of it happening in this final season. Firstly, he\u2019s being set up as an obstacle between Nancy and Jonathan, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a satisfying way to make Stancy canon. Unless the writers screw up these three characters\u2019 arcs (more than they did with the fourth season), Steve will not be getting the girl. Not getting the girl doesn\u2019t mean said girl won\u2019t care about his death though, and Steve is definitely a character whose death would affect other characters without ruining their happiness too much. I can picture a happy ending for Robin even if Steve dies (of course she would mourn her best friend\u2019s death and be affected by it), and even Dustin may come out of it psychologically healthy enough to have a believable happy ending. Steve\u2019s arc would wrap up nicely with him realizing that his search for romantic love wasn\u2019t that big of a need for him because the love that truly matters (platonic love from his best friends) was already enough. Him dying to protect said friends would be a satisfying end, even if it would be a really sad one for the fans. But I also don\u2019t make this guess with a lot of certainty, I don\u2019t feel confident enough about it to really scream \u201cSTEVE WILL DIE\u201d. It could go either way, but I do think that if someone from the main cast is killed it\u2019s gonna be him (or Robin).\n\nI don\u2019t see a way for Vecna to survive the show (unless he\u2019s forever stuck in the upside down or something) so I won\u2019t really talk about him. Instead, I\u2019ll touch upon the Wheeler parents. Karen will definitely be attacked by a Demogorgon in episode 2 but I do think she will be taken to the hospital \u2014 and why would she be taken there if she wasn\u2019t going to survive? To prolong Nancy\u2019s pain a little bit? I did think she would die initially, but after seeing the scene of Nancy washing her hands in the hospital, I just think it would be pointless to go through so much trouble to take her to the hospital only to kill her off right after. On the other hand, Ted might not live to tell the story. While having this attack be what wakes him up finally and make him start really taking care of his family (and value his wife) would be a good direction to take his character, I kinda think it\u2019s not the direction they\u2019ll take him\u2026 someone has to die for the stakes to feel existent, so Ted is the safest choice to kill without upsetting the characters or the fans too much. Sure, the Wheelers will be devastated in a way, but Ted\u2019s death is more beneficial to their arcs than his survival. Karen won\u2019t be stuck with her deadbeat husband and the kids aren\u2019t shown to be close enough to Ted to be depressed for a long time. It would be a nice redemption arc if he survived, but I don\u2019t know if he will\u2026 \n\nMurray is somewhat prone to dying as well: his death would definitely raise the stakes but it would be that upsetting either. Hopper and Joyce might grieve him for a bit, but in the end he really wasn\u2019t that close to the other characters. Him not being present in the epilogue wouldn\u2019t make it seem like a sad ending, so he\u2019s a safe kill choice to make. He\u2019s my biggest death bet overall (except probably Vecna). \n\nIn the end, I really can\u2019t imagine the writers killing many characters off. There may be some secondary characters dying, but I think that only one or two main characters will die, three at most \u2014 and my bets for that possibility would be Steve, Robin and Eleven. But still I don\u2019t think it\u2019s very likely. It\u2019s kinda unfortunate for viewers like me who really like high stakes and deaths, but Stranger Things has always been a story about the good winning in the end. A part of me does hope I\u2019m wrong, but I don\u2019t have high hopes for it. And I don\u2019t mean it in a bad way, I think I\u2019ll like the ending despite how many people die! I trust the writers will do a good job with the characters, no matter if their arcs conclude in death or not. This concludes my thoughts, so thanks for reading!", "timestamp": 1763736224, "label": "1"}

{"original_topic": "stranger_things", "comment": "My death prediction for season five As season five is coming up, I have made a list of people who will die in season five. This my prediction and here's my explanation. \n\n\n\nHere are the list: \n\n1) Lt Colonel Jack Sullivan. He's most definitely going to die in season five. My explanation is that he and his soldiers are going to be attacked by Vecna and the Demogorgons. We saw the trailer and promo of Demogorgons attacking and fighting the U.S. soldiers. He believes that Eleven is the source, but he's stubborn and mouth breather. Vecna might deal with him and see that he is 100 percent wrong about Eleven. \n\n2) Andy. If you don't know, Andy is one of Jason's friends and teammate of the basketball team. We see an image promo of him and his buddy Chance bullying Dustin because he's in Hellfire Club and blames Eddie for the rift. He still belives in Jason's cause and beliefs. I hope he and his basketball team are next when the Demogorgons are unleashed in Hawkins. We saw promos and trailers of Demogorgons attacking in the hospital, road, the town center, and Mike's house. Andy is a mouth breather and he'll be wrong when he see that Eddie was innocent and Jason was a psycho once the Demogorgon or Vecna confronts him.\n\n3) Chance. Chance is another friend of Jason and member of the basketball team. He looks like a villain when I saw the promo image of him smiling sinisterly when Andy bullied Dustin. He's a mouth breather and he'll might likely to be attacked by the Demogorgons once they attacked the town under Vecna's orders. Hope he'll see Jason, again. Well, half of him. \n\n4) The guy from the town meeting in 4x6. He's the guy that has a beard, glasses and a hat. He looks overweight. He was the first one to join Jason's cause during his Mouth breathing speech. He and Jason are the cause of the rifts to be open and let Vecna win. He was walking with his dog and spotted the party in Creel house, and informed Jason about it. I think he'll be the first one to die when the Demogorgons or Vecna starts their invasion. If he does, then he deserve it. \n\n5) Dr Kay. I think she'll might be defeated by Vecna or Demogorgons in season five but we don't know if it does or not. She's the new character and played by Linda Hamilton. She's aftering Eleven and wants her alive. I think she's working for Lt Colonel Jack Sullivan. \n\n6) Robert Akers. From what I learned from the cast list, he's working with Dr Kay to help capture Eleven alive. I think he'll be next from the Demogorgons attacked or Vecna.\n\n7) Vecna/One/Henry Creel. He will be defeated by The Party but we're not sure who will defeat him. Either Eleven or Will but we'll find out once season five is fully release on Netflix. \n\nHonorable mentions of those who will most likely to die: \n\n1) Powell and Callahan. These guys will most likely sacrificed themselves to save Hopper and Eleven. I think but we'll see. \n\n2) Ted Wheeler. He'll sacrificed himself to save his family from Demogorgons and Vecna. We even seen Nancy crying when she was washing her hands with blood in the teasers, trailers, and promo. I think it might be Ted Wheeler since everyone is talking about it. \n\n3)  Victor Creel. If Vecna/One/Henry Creel shows up at the asylum where his dad is located, he'll might visit him one last time before finishing him off. I think. \n\n4) Dr Owens. He'll might sacrificed himself to save Eleven and give her advice and tips to defeat Vecna.\n\n5) The basketball team and other people who believe in Jason's belief. I hope the Demogorgons and Vecna deal with him because they'll see that Jason is wrong and a mouth breather. \n\n6) Angela and her friends. If they show up in Hawkins and tries to come after Eleven. Vecna will deal with them and say there can only be one and that's Vecna. \n\n\nIf you wonder where's the rest of the main characters and why they are not part of the list, here's why. The reason is that I hope they all survive and defeat Vecna because they all deserve a happy ending. I mean, they went through so much in the past four seasons, and they deserve better. Mike, Eleven, Lucas, Dustin, Will, Nancy, Johnathan, Joyce, Hopper, Murray, Erica, Steve, Robin, Max, Vickie, Holly, Karen, and anyone from the party deserve better. \n\nI know everyone is worry about their fates since this is the final season, but we'll see what happens next once the final season comes out. I'm not ready as well because this is the last time we'll see our favorite characters for their one last epic adventure. The Party will defeat Vecna and avenge those they lost in the past such as Barbara, Bob, Alexi, Billy, Chrissy, Fred, and Eddie. We'll never forget them. Get ready because season five is coming in 6 days.", "timestamp": 1763736224, "label": "1"}

{"original_topic": "stranger_things", "comment": "Mike appreciation. Here's a list of things he has done: Season 1\n\n- D&amp;D Dungeon Master - something nobody likes to be\n- Provided his basement as the main hangout spot \n- Took in a young girl in trouble purely out of kindness \n- Let Eleven hide in his basement for months \n- Brought Eleven back home even after everyone thought she had lied about Will being alive just for shelter \n- Believed Eleven and inevitably discovered proof of Will being alive \n- Hatched a plan to save Will \n- Tried to keep Eleven safe from the Hawkins baddies \n\nSeason 2\n\n- Called Eleven everyday for 353 days when everyone thought she had died \n- Paid attention to Will and got him out of his trance everytime he had an \"episode\" (e.g. outside the arcade, or halloween) \n- Stuck with Will when he got worse because of the Mind Flayer possessing him \n- Figured out that Will could spy on the MF, which was the only reason they were able to find and save Hopper from the tunnels \n- Figured out Will was spying back (but it was too late) \n- Encouraged his friends to come up with a plan to help Eleven and Hopper when they went to close the gate in season 2. This leads them back to the tunnels where they burn the shit out of the hub WHICH also helps Joyce and Co. when they're exorcising Will. \n\nSeason 3\n\n- Finally starts dating Eleven and spends most of his summer in her cabin since she can't leave and be seen by too many people \n- Immediately mobilises the troops (all the friends) when he realises the mindflayer is back \n- Plans the Sauna Test to check if Billy is flayed \n- Slams the shit outta Billy when he's choking Eleven\n- IS THE ONLY ONE WHO IS CONCERNED ABOUT \nELEVEN'S HEALTH AND SAFETY WHEN SHE'S USING HER POWERS TO HELP AND SAVE EVERYONE \n- Uses physics to turn the car upside down when Eleven's powers don't work\n- Emotional support for Eleven when she loses her powers \n\nSeason 4 \n\n- Visits Eleven and Will in California over Spring Break \n- Leaves with Will and Jonathan to find Eleven when they realise the Hawkins baddies have her again\n- Figures out that the pen from unknown hero agent man was the clue to finding Eleven\n- Hatches a plan to find Suzie so that she can find Eleven's location\n- Saves Eleven with the help of Jonathan, Will, and Argyle\n- Expresses his unconditional love for Eleven when she needs it the most, helping her defeat Vecna (at least temporarily)\n\n\nI am tired of all the Mike hate. It is fckn ridiculous. \n\nMike has been the kindest and nicest little boy since the beginning. There's a reason Will called him \"the heart.\" Without Mike being the way he is they never would've found Eleven, and by extention, Will. The other kids are all smart as well but nobody is as kind as Mike. I'm probably even missing some other good stuff he's done because I'm writing this based off of what I remember. \n\n- Being mean to Max in s2 is just a teenager lashing out. He hates that Eleven isn't around and is annoyed that Max is. \n\n- Being distant from his friends during summer vacation in S3 was completely justified. That kid called Eleven everyday for 353 days in s2 and then in s3 she's finally here, not dying or under threat. What did you expect? lol. \nIt was also just during summer vacation that they were spending all day together. Mike was not some obsessed creep who was skipping school to make out with Eleven.\n\nI'm tired of people complaining about Mike being a dick to Will in s4. He is a child. He doesn't even know Will is gay, since Will has never told anyone. His own mother does not know this about him. Jonathan only realises this because of their road trip, and the fact that he's older than Mike and knows Will much better since he's his BROTHER. Mike has proven his loyalty to Will, time and again, and people still hate on the kid for god knows what. \n\nMike has been absolutely consistent in his character from the beginning. He does stupid things sometimes like \"it's not my fault you don't like girls\" but that's just a teenager being a teenager. \n\nSTOP HATING ON A LITERAL CHILD. \n\nDownvote me. I don't care.

Don't read ANY further!!\n\nFirst of all,  I was going to say. Wow that's long. Almost 3 hours. Why do ALL the characters behave like they're being chased by demogorgons or Vecna himself by the way they speak so freaking fast?! Like damn, enunciate! They honestly all talk in a frenzy it's weird. It's honestly chaotic to watch.\n\nAnyway, these are my interesting observations:\n\n* I read here years ago that someone is speculating that 000 is Dr. Brenner. Well, they're half right! LOL. Dr. Brenner's father IS 000! He was the first surviving victim of the MF.\n* They're kind of hinting that Joyce is a lesbian? Well there's a scene where they're outright saying SHE's a lesbian! Is there going to be a Robin phase revelation of Joyce in S5? Also from what I saw I think she is a lesbian!  Joyce does not seem to be interested in either Hopper or Bob. Now about Lonnie, not sure if they really were dating because I don't remember seeing them as a couple in the play?\n* Karen is the MF!!! Well at least that's what I gathered from that one scene of hers. Where her clothes were off and she is wearing a spider bra! And she also has a pentagon cauldron? Ya Karen IS the big bad not Vecna!\n* There's a confusing scene with Hopper where he is acting like Norman Bates level PSYCHO. I am not sure if that was part of the play in the show or what REALLY is happening in Hawkins. Ya the show is confusing, it's UNREAL! Did Hopper kill his parents?? Hopper is also abused by his father like BILLY!\n* Vecna's parents LOVE him. His mom loves him. I think the MF made him think he is unloved. There's also a scene where Dr. Brenner gave her pills to take. That was the day Henry was returned to his care the 2nd time. So it seems to me. Dr. Brenner drugged Henry's mom to make her do what he wants?\n\n  \nThat's what I remember were PRETTY interesting scenes.

{"original_topic": "stranger_things", "comment": "Stranger Things had an insane first Season. Season 1 is so packed in its plotline. Like they didn't wasted a single second. Zero second of fillers and the storyline is just so packed and well paced. \n\nThe show had this perfect balance of mystery, horror, thrill and heart back then. Season 1 feels like lightning in a bottle. Small town, small cast and one central mission, find Will. The world hadn't exploded into ten different storylines yet, the tension stayed insane. \n\nThe scale being small did wonders. One missing kid. One group of boys. One grieving mom. One girl with powers. One shady lab. That\u2019s it. And somehow it felt massive because the stakes were so personal.\n\nNo matter how big the show gets, that first season is always going to feel like lightning in a bottle. It set the tone perfectly. And this is why Season 2 is my 2nd favourite Season, it had the essence of Season 1. \n\nSeason 2 is the closest the show ever got to recapturing that formula. It felt like Hawkins wasn\u2019t drowning in plot threads unlike the later seasons. The characters were dealing with the fallout of Season 1, everyone was still connected, the tone stayed grounded, and Will\u2019s possession arc was just so damn strong.", "timestamp": 1763736226, "label": "1"}

First gotta say that Winona ryder was the best part for me getting into it as her acting was phenomenal, I do believe season 1 and 3 were the  best seasons for me while 2 was the lowest of them all. Dustin, steve, and joy were my favorites.  Some negatives for me were how they gave no storyline for Jonathan in later seasons, he was my favorite and was glad he ended up with Nancy but  at the end of season 4 I kind of wanted Nancy to break up and get back with Steve. Eddie was one of the best characters added at the end while I coudnt really say the same about argyles character, I can totally see why they didn't invite him back as his characters tone and vibe wouldn't clash well for the final season. My last negative was wtf was the storyline with 11's sister, I can't be the only one who skipped it cause it was uninteresting", "timestamp": 1763736226, "label": "1"}

{"original_topic": "stranger_things", "comment": "Anyone else really dislike Hopper? He\u2019s so toxic. \n\nEleven went through unimaginable trauma. She was treated like a lab rat for her entire life growing up, didn\u2019t have family, just experiments they did on her. She couldn\u2019t even interact regularly with others when she first escaped. She was then hunted by the lab as she experienced the first time what it\u2019s like being a human around others who aren\u2019t abusing her.\n\nEnter Hopper, her next abuser.\n\nHe essentially lures her and traps her in his house for over a year, not letting her leave, by scaring her so much. She went from a physical prison in the lab to a mental prison with Hopper. The only people she ever had any relationship with, just a few miles away, yet she can\u2019t see them or interact with them. Until she herself finally got the courage to rebel and break free from the mental prison he put her in. And he did this cause it made him feel good about losing his own daughter. He used her like a prop for his own soothing, all while talking to her and treating her like trash.\n\nAfter she finds out her mom is brain dead stuck in a recurring nightmare, and has no family left, Eleven finally reunited with Mike and the gang only because they found out she was alive. If it was for hopper to decide he would\u2019ve kept her mentally locked up in that house forever. She only now gets to leave because Hopper\u2019s cover is blown and he can\u2019t entrap her any more. \n\nThen when she starts forming the first real relationships in her life, and has Mike as her BF, Hopper is so toxic that he can\u2019t just let her be. Even Joyce tries to explain to him it\u2019s ok for her and Mike to be with each other like that. But Hopper can\u2019t stand to have her out of his control so much so that he gloats in literally threatening and bullying a child to stay away from Eleven and to further isolate her from others. There was no reason to do that. Literally none. He just couldn\u2019t stand that the relationship existed so for his own pleasure he destroyed it to further isolate her.\n\nHis abuse isn\u2019t as apparent as it should be. I\u2019m sure many people watching this show are saying \u201che\u2019s an overall good guy though.\u201d That\u2019s only cause he\u2019s taken on a cop savior role as his profession. To be clear, he\u2019s so useless as a cop that he himself doesn\u2019t figure things out. It\u2019s usually the kids or someone else figuring it out and he just provides man power to help assist. So he\u2019s not even that good at his job really. But his role and the little support he does give to main characters gives him an appearance of legitimacy and like he\u2019s a good guy and not an actual abuser to Eleven. \n\nHe also uses circumstances to hide his abuse. Like Eleven being hunted or needing to keep her identity hidden. That might be true but it doesn\u2019t require isolating her from others so much and treating her like trash while she\u2019s there. He goes way overboard on that because it helps him with his own trauma. \n\nThe saddest part is that Eleven has been abused so long in her life that, like Stockholm syndrome, she sees him as a good guy. The same way she saw Papa as good and built a bond with him when he abused her at the lab. \n\nWhen I thought Hopper died at the end of season 3, I thought wow he finally got a just end. Finally he\u2019s out of the show. Only for him to come back season 4 and find a way to waste screen time by being in a Russian prison and a side quest for Joyce that could\u2019ve been cut from the show without much impact. \n\nThis is one of the worst characters in the show. Even the way he smokes cigarettes and looks like his face is dirty all the time with unkept hair like he hasn\u2019t showered in a week and is out of shape cause he doesn\u2019t take care of himself. He has little to no redeeming qualities. \n\nI\u2019m not saying the guy is doing the abusing on purpose. I\u2019m saying he\u2019s so toxic that he\u2019s an abuser and he himself doesn\u2019t even realize it. Eleven doesn\u2019t either from Stockholm syndrome. And others aren\u2019t close enough to him and his relationship to Eleven to even know.", "timestamp": 1763736226, "label": "0"}
{"original_topic": "stranger_things", "comment": "my death predictions for the last season! Hey! I\u2019ve been thinking about the last season a lot as it approaches, and after watching some prediction videos about who might die in this last act of the show I decided to share my own thoughts! Even though I\u2019m the kind of person who loves when shows aren\u2019t afraid to kill off characters, Stranger Things has been proving time and time again that it\u2019s not that kind of story. So even if I long for a bigger kill count to raise the stakes, I genuinely don\u2019t think many characters are at risk of dying. Having said so, let me break my thoughts down for you! \n\nFirstly, I think Erica is completely safe! It\u2019s a bold affirmation to make, saying someone has zero percent chances of dying, but I can\u2019t see a reason for why they would kill her off. She doesn\u2019t seem to be involved in Lucas or Dustin\u2019s plot lines this season, and since they\u2019re the only two characters who have an emotional connection to her, her death wouldn\u2019t really be emotionally satisfying with anyone else around\u2026 she might join Lucas\u2019 storyline at some point, but I really can\u2019t see them killing her off because Lucas\u2019 main focus this season will be protecting Max. Killing his sister, while an interesting possibility for his arc, would probably make him too distraught to focus on anything else. Besides that, I also just genuinely don\u2019t think there\u2019s a way to make her death be satisfying. While killing a younger kid like her would show how horrifying the whole situation is, Erica is just far too removed from the other characters and the plot itself. Killing her off would make an impact too big for a character with so little relevance like her, if that makes sense? I just don\u2019t think the writers are willing to give her that much importance, she\u2019s not that central to the narrative and the story wouldn\u2019t benefit from it.\n\nFor the original party, the only one I can imagine them killing off is Will but I also don\u2019t think the writers will go there. I have conflicting thoughts about Will: while I would love for him to die in a \u201cit started with him, it has to end with him too\u201d way, I also think that it\u2019s an ending too dark for what the writers want their story to be. One could argue that killing Will would make the story feel unsatisfying because \u201cwhy would they go through so much to save him only for him to die in the end\u201d, and while I don\u2019t completely agree (mainly because I love tragic stories), I kinda can\u2019t argue against it. Will dying would completely break Joyce, and I just can\u2019t see a way for her to bounce back from that. I can\u2019t imagine a happy ending \u2014 which is what the writers seem to want to write \u2014 for her if Will dies, so I\u2019m pretty sure he survives. The other three boys are even less likely to die: Lucas is probably the most likely to be killed off out of the three, but I just can\u2019t picture him dying before Max wakes up and I can\u2019t imagine her having a happy ending with him dead (so unless Max also dies, Lucas is kinda safe on my book); Dustin sacrificing himself for the others wouldn\u2019t be a bad ending per se, but it would kinda make Eddie\u2019s sacrifice feel pointless, and I just don\u2019t think it would be a good move to kill character who used to be so cheery and heart-warming in the season where they\u2019re having an arc about dealing badly with someone\u2019s death (and also there are just too many people willing to sacrifice themselves for him); finally, Mike would be a super interesting choice for a death, but I can\u2019t imagine them killing him off. Mike needs to be there for the emotional impact of Eleven and Will\u2019s character arcs, whatever their endings may be, so he\u2019s also safe in my book. Also, I just can\u2019t imagine a happy ending for the Wheelers if he dies.\n\nSimilarly, I just can\u2019t picture a happy ending for them if Holly dies. She\u2019s having a more important role in the season, and judging from the leaks it would be kinda pointless to have her going on a side quest with Henry Creel/Vecna if she ends up dying in the end. The Wheelers (Mike and Nancy particularly, maybe Karen too if she isn\u2019t incapacitated the whole season) will go out of their way to save Holly after her disappearance, I doubt the writers would write that plot line only for it to end in the most unsatisfying end of all: Holly dying. I won\u2019t completely rule it out because it could be pulled off, but I seriously doubt they want to go with that route. \n\nSimilarly to Mike, I can\u2019t fathom a reality where Joyce isn\u2019t present in the final showdown to raise the emotional stakes for Eleven and Will. Her death would be bittersweet since her goal from day one was to protect her son from danger, and it wouldn\u2019t be completely unsatisfying if written correctly, but I just can\u2019t imagine it. I don\u2019t know if her children or Hopper would be able to bounce back from her death, and I feel like I don\u2019t even need to imagine it because she has very low chances of dying. I just can\u2019t see it, genuinely. Hopper is in a very similar place but slightly more likely to die because he doesn\u2019t have as many close connections (in that level) as Joyce, but they already did a fake-out with him so\u2026 I just feel like it would be cheap to repeat it. Eleven losing him twice would be devastating, and Joyce too after already having lost Bob. It\u2019s just really unlikely, I don\u2019t think he dies. \n\nAbout Max, I don\u2019t see a reason for them to keep her alive if they were going to kill her off in the next season. Again, killing a character after a fake-out feels cheap, especially when said character\u2019s death wouldn\u2019t align with the show\u2019s intended happy finale. Having Max go through so much just for her to die would be devastating, it would feel pointless and would give an awful message that no matter how hard you (a character who has been kicked down by life time and time again) fight, you can\u2019t escape the misery you lived in\u2026 I could accept her death in season four despite this, but the fake-out just makes it feel even more cruel. Why give her another chance only to rip it away again?\n\nThis is how I feel about Eleven as well. Her death would also give that impression, but my main problem isn\u2019t even that: I could see her dying if it didn\u2019t hurt Hopper\u2019s arc directly. Make him lose his daughter twice? He wouldn\u2019t bounce back. At most, I can see her sacrificing herself in a different way (maybe staying in the Upside Down, even if it\u2019s still unsatisfying) or just leaving Hawkins at the end of the story, but I don\u2019t know\u2026 she could go either way but I\u2019m leaning towards her survival as well. I won\u2019t be super shocked if she dies but I still believe she will survive in some way, however that way may be. \n\nMoving on to the teens, I think that Nancy and Jonathan will have the happy ending they deserve which means they will end up together living happily ever after. The one I can imagine dying the most is Jonathan because his arc has always been about taking care of others, but I just don\u2019t think Nancy or the Byers could achieve a truly happy ending if he were to die, and the same with Jonathan and the Wheelers for Nancy. They are too central for each other\u2026 I could see them dying but I just genuinely don\u2019t think the writers will do that, even if they did do a major disservice to Jonathan\u2019s character arc in the previous two seasons (not necessarily about him doing drugs, but just generally making him irrelevant). \n\nAbout Robin, I am kinda fearful for her future but as time goes on I\u2019m more certain of her survival\u2026 it just seems weird to kill her off after making her love interest (Vicky) more relevant. I do think there may be a somewhat good way to pull her death off, but I kinda just don\u2019t see them doing it? I won\u2019t completely rule it out, but the \u201cbury your gays\u201d trope just doesn\u2019t seem like something the writers might want to touch upon\u2026 but I don\u2019t know! Maybe her and Vicky having a relationship is a way for Robin\u2019s character to feel more fulfilled before killing her off? Maybe they\u2019ll kill Vicky before her? Even though I was initially concerned about her, I will stick to her survival. I do think it could go either way! \n\nOut of the main cast (I don\u2019t think of Murray or Vecna as main cast), Steve is definitely the most likely to die. Yes, he\u2019s been predicted to sacrifice himself for a long time now, but I do think there are some chances of it happening in this final season. Firstly, he\u2019s being set up as an obstacle between Nancy and Jonathan, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a satisfying way to make Stancy canon. Unless the writers screw up these three characters\u2019 arcs (more than they did with the fourth season), Steve will not be getting the girl. Not getting the girl doesn\u2019t mean said girl won\u2019t care about his death though, and Steve is definitely a character whose death would affect other characters without ruining their happiness too much. I can picture a happy ending for Robin even if Steve dies (of course she would mourn her best friend\u2019s death and be affected by it), and even Dustin may come out of it psychologically healthy enough to have a believable happy ending. Steve\u2019s arc would wrap up nicely with him realizing that his search for romantic love wasn\u2019t that big of a need for him because the love that truly matters (platonic love from his best friends) was already enough. Him dying to protect said friends would be a satisfying end, even if it would be a really sad one for the fans. But I also don\u2019t make this guess with a lot of certainty, I don\u2019t feel confident enough about it to really scream \u201cSTEVE WILL DIE\u201d. It could go either way, but I do think that if someone from the main cast is killed it\u2019s gonna be him (or Robin).\n\nI don\u2019t see a way for Vecna to survive the show (unless he\u2019s forever stuck in the upside down or something) so I won\u2019t really talk about him. Instead, I\u2019ll touch upon the Wheeler parents. Karen will definitely be attacked by a Demogorgon in episode 2 but I do think she will be taken to the hospital \u2014 and why would she be taken there if she wasn\u2019t going to survive? To prolong Nancy\u2019s pain a little bit? I did think she would die initially, but after seeing the scene of Nancy washing her hands in the hospital, I just think it would be pointless to go through so much trouble to take her to the hospital only to kill her off right after. On the other hand, Ted might not live to tell the story. While having this attack be what wakes him up finally and make him start really taking care of his family (and value his wife) would be a good direction to take his character, I kinda think it\u2019s not the direction they\u2019ll take him\u2026 someone has to die for the stakes to feel existent, so Ted is the safest choice to kill without upsetting the characters or the fans too much. Sure, the Wheelers will be devastated in a way, but Ted\u2019s death is more beneficial to their arcs than his survival. Karen won\u2019t be stuck with her deadbeat husband and the kids aren\u2019t shown to be close enough to Ted to be depressed for a long time. It would be a nice redemption arc if he survived, but I don\u2019t know if he will\u2026 \n\nMurray is somewhat prone to dying as well: his death would definitely raise the stakes but it would be that upsetting either. Hopper and Joyce might grieve him for a bit, but in the end he really wasn\u2019t that close to the other characters. Him not being present in the epilogue wouldn\u2019t make it seem like a sad ending, so he\u2019s a safe kill choice to make. He\u2019s my biggest death bet overall (except probably Vecna). \n\nIn the end, I really can\u2019t imagine the writers killing many characters off. There may be some secondary characters dying, but I think that only one or two main characters will die, three at most \u2014 and my bets for that possibility would be Steve, Robin and Eleven. But still I don\u2019t think it\u2019s very likely. It\u2019s kinda unfortunate for viewers like me who really like high stakes and deaths, but Stranger Things has always been a story about the good winning in the end. A part of me does hope I\u2019m wrong, but I don\u2019t have high hopes for it. And I don\u2019t mean it in a bad way, I think I\u2019ll like the ending despite how many people die! I trust the writers will do a good job with the characters, no matter if their arcs conclude in death or not. This concludes my thoughts, so thanks for reading!", "timestamp": 1763736226, "label": "1"}

{"original_topic": "euphoria", "comment": "Euphoria really destroyed its potential Hey y\u2019all, so I was bored and decided to rewatch Euphoria, and dang guys season 1 is literally so peak. I really feel like Euphoria stands out from all these other high school dramas because the aesthetic and cinematography is just beautiful, not to mention that I also feel like the characters are super realistic (not so much the whole high school aspect because every one of these bitches would be dress coded in two seconds if it was the real world lol) but just the way the characters think and feel, I mean I\u2019m in college now but when season 1 first came out, I was a sophomore in high school and the characters were just so relatable to me.\n\nBut I\u2019m not gonna lie, Euphoria really just wasted away all of its potential with season 2 and how they\u2019re treating the release of season 3. First of all, season 2 was lowkey trash. There wasn\u2019t much in the way of character development or just overall storyline, and after rewatching season 2, it really just feels kind of dragged on. When the hype was going on for season 2, people treated this show like it could do no wrong and so did I, but now I really just feel like season 2 is pretty bad. Lexi\u2019s play was also so unnecessary, like I get that they were trying to show how she was coming out of her shell and stuff, but I feel like they could have done that in a much better way, we as the audience really didn\u2019t need a whole recap of the events of season 1 in a school play that would have never been allowed to exist in a real school. Outside of just the writing though, I mean these people have waited SO LONG to release the next season, it\u2019s gonna be 4 years by the time the new season comes out. I know there were unexpected deaths from the cast which is just a tragedy, but it\u2019s been so long and there\u2019s so many people missing in the show now that I feel like people aren\u2019t even excited about this show anymore, and they should lowkey just call it good, but of course they\u2019re gonna milk it financially for all that it\u2019s worth. It just kind of sucks because season 1 had the potential to make the show the best modern teen drama ever made, yet it failed so miserably.", "timestamp": 1763736228, "label": "0"}

Since S3 is taken place \u201c5 years later\u201d\u2026 why would you want Maddy to be stuck on something from 5 years ago? Something from HS? Me, personally\u2026 I let everything from HS go, probably the Summer I graduated. 5 years post HS, I definitely wasn\u2019t thinking of exes, old friendships nor drama from HS. I was focusing on my future and growing. To me, that\u2019s what I\u2019d want to see Maddy doing. Leaving Cassie and Nate\u2019s drama behind her and being the bad diva that she is. 5 years is a long time, I understand feelings of betrayal sucks.

{"original_topic": "euphoria", "comment": "Euphoria really destroyed its potential Hey y\u2019all, so I was bored and decided to rewatch Euphoria, and dang guys season 1 is literally so peak. I really feel like Euphoria stands out from all these other high school dramas because the aesthetic and cinematography is just beautiful, not to mention that I also feel like the characters are super realistic (not so much the whole high school aspect because every one of these bitches would be dress coded in two seconds if it was the real world lol) but just the way the characters think and feel, I mean I\u2019m in college now but when season 1 first came out, I was a sophomore in high school and the characters were just so relatable to me.\n\nBut I\u2019m not gonna lie, Euphoria really just wasted away all of its potential with season 2 and how they\u2019re treating the release of season 3. First of all, season 2 was lowkey trash. There wasn\u2019t much in the way of character development or just overall storyline, and after rewatching season 2, it really just feels kind of dragged on. When the hype was going on for season 2, people treated this show like it could do no wrong and so did I, but now I really just feel like season 2 is pretty bad. Lexi\u2019s play was also so unnecessary, like I get that they were trying to show how she was coming out of her shell and stuff, but I feel like they could have done that in a much better way, we as the audience really didn\u2019t need a whole recap of the events of season 1 in a school play that would have never been allowed to exist in a real school. Outside of just the writing though, I mean these people have waited SO LONG to release the next season, it\u2019s gonna be 4 years by the time the new season comes out. I know there were unexpected deaths from the cast which is just a tragedy, but it\u2019s been so long and there\u2019s so many people missing in the show now that I feel like people aren\u2019t even excited about this show anymore, and they should lowkey just call it good, but of course they\u2019re gonna milk it financially for all that it\u2019s worth. It just kind of sucks because season 1 had the potential to make the show the best modern teen drama ever made, yet it failed so miserably.", "timestamp": 1763736228, "label": "0"}

{"original_topic": "breaking_bad", "comment": "Daily reminder that neither Mike nor Walt were \"right\" or \"wrong\", they were both pretty terrible people I saw a post yesterday about how Mike was wrong in his argument against Walt about how they had a good thing and Walt blew it up. I actually don't disagree with everything said about Mike's \"points\". I agree with a lot of it. \n\nI think Gus had Tomas murdered or at least knew that's what the dealers would do. Think about it. Gus' big thing is that his people don't operate without his consent or knowledge. Gus liked these dealers so much, he risked his relationship with Walt to protect them. There's no way they did that without Gus having at least mild knowledge of it. I think it was a play to get Jesse killed. Jesse goes to retaliate, believing Walt wouldn't care or react or even know about it until Jesse had already gone to the dealers. They were already waiting for him, Jesse gets gunned down and Gus consoles Walt after having the dealers killed by Mike for killing Tomas and causing the situation to begin with. Now Gus has Walt, his perfect lab and no more \"junkie\". Walt knew this, he figured it out and literally told Gus that hypothetically Jesse might have believed it was Gus' doing. The show writers wouldn't have Walt say this unless they wanted us to think about it. \n\nBut does that make Walt the good guy? Or Mike? No. Mike wanted to kill Jesse for a long time. He wanted to kill Jesse just for doing drugs after his girlfriend died. Literally told Walt, \"Let me take care of it\" intending to kill Jesse at a drug house when he was consumed with grief. The same Mike that we're supposed to believe saw Jesse as a son. \n\nOn the flip side, Mike figured Walt out and knew exactly what kind of man Walt was. Walt isn't a saint. He kept Jesse alive for his own selfish reasons. He used Jesse, manipulated him, took advantage of him. And let's not forget... Walt caused Jane to turn over and choke and then stood there while she choked. Walt is also the reason they got mixed up with Gus to begin with. \n\nHere's the list of garbage moves Walt made that caused Jesse's life to get progressively worse at every turn: \n\n1. When they were making cash hand over fist, Walt freaked out about Skinny Pete getting mugged which is absolutely a thing that dealers have to deal with. This put Jesse in a compromising situation for a wad of cash that they could easily make back on the back end. No retaliation is bad for business? You can retaliate in other ways. Black list those \"customers\" and they'll find a way to pay you back. Like Jesse said, they had the best product and no one else was dealing because Tuco was dead. \n\n2. After Jesse gets caught up in a situation that leads to a man's death, he starts getting cocky and pushes for them to expand. He tries to act like a know it all, pulling out a map and *teaching* Jesse, the one who is in charge of business, new areas to expand to. Jesse literally warns him that going into new territory will lead to violent encounters but Walt is happy to milk the MISBELIEF that Jesse killed Spooge even though he knows Jesse and his crew are no killers. At this point, they don't even have junior dealers working for Badger, Skinny Pete or Combo. \n\n3. Every single thing that Jesse warned Walt about happens. First, Badger gets arrested which costs them $80k to resolve. This also loses them a dealer. And then, disaster: Combo gets killed. Where? In new territory where Gus' dealers are. This means they're down two dealers and only have Skinny Pete. And he naturally wants out because Combo is dead. This also puts Jesse under tremendous stress which leads to him leaning heavily into drugs. Walt starts worrying about how they're going to sell 50 pounds of product, but he doesn't seem AT ALL worried about Jesse. He finagles a deal with a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy and manages to get a deal to sell all of his product to Gus. At this point, there's no doubt that Gus is most likely buying it just to get it off the market. \n\nThe entire reason they end up in business with Gus, the entire reason Combo was killed by Gus' dealers, the entire reason this whole business deal with Gus even starts is due to **WALT'S EGO**. His ego is also what led to them having their run-in with Tuco. Walt was angry about $1500-$2000 a day being too slow for him and wanted to sell to a distributor. Walt was angry about needing pseudo for a traditional cook so he concocted the plan to steal methylamine. Out of everyone, Gus and Walt are the only ones who didn't want to \"get out\" of the business. \n\nMike was a lot of things, and up until he finally warmed up to Jesse, he was a piece of shit in a lot of ways, but he wasn't in the business to be in the business. He was happy to get out ahead at various points in the series. Him and Jesse were willing to walk away, sell their shares of the methylamine and walk away with more money than they could've earned in a lifetime. But who wanted to stay? Walt. \n\nIt's easy to see Walt as the reasonable one who wanted to help Jesse. But it's important to understand that almost every time Walt \"saved\" Jesse, he was saving Jesse from a horrible situation that **he himself** put Jesse in.", "timestamp": 1763736238, "label": "0"}

{"original_topic": "breaking_bad", "comment": "Majority of the show happened in 1 year - and that's actually pretty realistic As most fans have figured that the majority of Breaking Bad happened in 2 years - with one year covering the first 4 seasons and first 3 episodes of season 5 and the remaining year was 13 episodes - some have said that this timeline is ridiculously unrealistic, but IMO it makes total sense, especially during binge watches. \n\nFrom my real life experiences, a lot can happen in one year, and sometimes 3-4 years and nothing changes besides that your best friend broke up with his girlfriend or your local Los Pollos joint gets shut down. It's all relative and based on perspectives. The same way people didn't know that the Beatles' discography only lasted about 7 years, because each album/image of the band was so different from one another.\n\n Breaking Bad happens to have a lot of events and multiple perspectives told through a lot of characters (who evolve a lot throughout the course of the series) with depths to them.

{"original_topic": "breaking_bad", "comment": "Walter White: A Narcissist, But Not Entirely Looking for information, I\u2019ve seen tons of articles referring to Walter\u2019s narcissism, yet I haven\u2019t seen anyone mention a detail that could be relevant. Walter is not a narcissist from the start. Early in the series, he is shown as an empathetic man who loves his son. Some psychiatrists argue that at this point he is already a narcissist because he feels life owes him something\u2014a better job, making ends meet comfortably. I don\u2019t find this accurate, because this feeling is very human and it\u2019s exactly what makes us connect with him in the first place.\n\nPrimary narcissism arises as a response to childhood trauma and develops during adolescence. It is reinforced by individual traits, and empathy is either lost or severely damaged. Walter, rather, is in a state of emotional paralysis; his son\u2019s words hurt or scare him, and the circumstances of his life crush him.\n\nWalter\u2019s narcissism is secondary and, unlike primary narcissism, it is temporary. When Walter decides to \u201cchange,\u201d all the ego he had been suppressing for decades and his crippling sense of shame explode. Walter has no emotional tools to channel what is happening to him or to make a smooth transition of the self. All his resentment is released in every direction, and these narcissistic traits intensify more and more.\n\nArt imitates life. Many men (and some women), when living emotionally repressed lives and repeating traumatic patterns, become alcoholics, unfaithful, addicted to gambling\u2026 during a midlife crisis.

{"original_topic": "breaking_bad", "comment": "I would like to defend Walter H. White from Mike's vicious character assassination. In Season 5 while involved in an argument with Walter - an argument which Walt admittedly ends up overreacting to - Mike says the following:\n\n\"We had a good thing you stupid son of a bitch. We had Fring. We had a lab. We had everything we needed and it all ran like clockwork. You could have shut your mouth, cooked, and made as much money as you ever needed. It was perfect. But no, you just had to blow it up. You and your pride and your ego. You just had to be the man. If you'd done your job, known your place, we'd all be fine right now.\"\n\nA lot of people in the fanbase celebrate this little speech from Mike, treating it as an epic takedown of Walt and talking as if it perfectly describes what happened between Walt and Gus.\n\nBut it doesn't! Walt's ego and pride had pretty much nothing to do with his falling out with Gus. Gus and Jesse's actions were the main drivers of the conflict - you could argue that Jesse was only involved to begin with because Walt insisted on it instead of \"shutting up and cooking\" but I think this is a real reach. Let's review what happened:\n\n1. Jesse discovered that the younger brother of a young woman he recently started a relationship with murdered his friend Combo, having been ordered to by a couple of dealers. He finds that these dealers work for Gus.\n\n2. Jesse begins plotting to kill the two dealers by poisoning them. Walt is concerned by this and after failing to talk Jesse down he instead tries to hatch a scheme with Saul to get Jesse arrested and take him off the streets so he can cool down. Gus finds out about this through Mike and then has Mike kidnap Jesse and bring him to a room to talk - in other words, Walt is the one trying hard to de-escalate the situation and Gus even makes it clear to Jesse that Walt is the only reason Gus didn't have him killed.\n\n3. After some back and forth, Gus agrees that he'll no longer use children in his operations in exchange for Jesse (very begrudgingly) agreeing to make peace with the dealers. Walt tries to make peace with Jesse but Jesse is still angry. At this point Walt has remained very calm and sensible the whole way, actively trying to avoid conflict with Gus.\n\n4. Shortly after, Jesse finds out that the kid Tom\u00e1s was murdered by the two dealers (Gus later claims that he did not know about this but we don't know for sure) and immediately resumes his murder plot against the two dealers.\n\n5. Wanting to protect Jesse, Walt instead kills the two dealers himself as he knows that he's more valuable than Jesse and Gus will be more reluctant to kill him than Jesse.\n\n6. Gus is very angry at this point and wants to kill Jesse. Walt **strongly suggests to Gus that he let it go, allow Jesse to skip town without pursuing him and he'll resume cooking.** Gus reluctantly agrees and reappoints Gale as Walt's new assistant.\n\n7. Although Gus agreed to move on, he has Victor monitor Walt very closely (showing clearly to Walt that he hasn't moved on) **and begins plotting to kill Walt and replace him with Gale.**\n\n8. Walt and Jesse realise that Gus is not going to let the whole thing go and that their only option for survival is to kill Gale. He's willing to do this only for self-preservation, because Gus will kill him and Jesse if he doesn't.\n\n9. Mike kidnaps Walter and takes him to the lab to execute him. Jesse manages to kill Gale first and so Gus is forced to keep Walt and Jesse alive so they can continue cooking.\n\n10. For some time after this a delicate truce is reached in which Gus has no choice but to keep Walt and Jesse alive so they can cook while Walt and Jesse know that the only thing keeping them alive is that they continue cooking. Admittedly Walt becomes increasingly paranoid and starts to behave erratically during this time and plots to kill Gus, but his paranoia turns out to be justified as Gus begins grooming Jesse to completely take over the lab so Gus can get rid of Walt.\n\n11. Eventually Gus is ready to kill Walt but Jesse insists that he won't continue to cook if Gus kills Walt. So instead Gus drags Walt out into the desert. fires him, threatens to murder his entire family and confirms that he intends to kill Walt's brother-in-law Hank. At this point Walt has no choice - for the sake of saving his brother-in-law's life and protecting his family against any future threat - but to go all in on his plan to kill Gus which he manages to do successfully.\n\n  \nNow let's look at who's to blame for the breakdown in Gus' operations.\n\nJesse is incredibly dumb and irrational in his response to the two dealers and created an irreparable rift with Gus **that Walt tried hard to de-escalate.** Walt wanted to 'shut up and cook', Jesse didn't.\n\nGus handled the situation poorly - largely because of his personal dislike of Jesse - and appeared to favour the two murderous dealers over Jesse who was much more irreplaceable in the operation. Jesse had a legitimate grievance with these two men that Gus didn't take seriously.\n\nDespite Walt's repeated attempts to resolve the whole thing without further violence, Jesse and Gus' actions created a series of escalating blows that forced Walt to eventually oppose Gus in order to save Jesse's life and later his own. Gus himself had multiple opportunities to put the thing to bed and let Walt 'shut up and cook', but once he decided to replace Walt with Gale he put Walt in a position where he had no choice but to blow up Gus' operation if he wanted to live.\n\nAnd yet Mike says the whole thing happened because of Walt's ego and the community have taken his word it. smdh.", "timestamp": 1763736239, "label": "1"}

{"original_topic": "breaking_bad", "comment": "Daily reminder that neither Mike nor Walt were \"right\" or \"wrong\", they were both pretty terrible people I saw a post yesterday about how Mike was wrong in his argument against Walt about how they had a good thing and Walt blew it up. I actually don't disagree with everything said about Mike's \"points\". I agree with a lot of it. \n\nI think Gus had Tomas murdered or at least knew that's what the dealers would do. Think about it. Gus' big thing is that his people don't operate without his consent or knowledge. Gus liked these dealers so much, he risked his relationship with Walt to protect them. There's no way they did that without Gus having at least mild knowledge of it. I think it was a play to get Jesse killed. Jesse goes to retaliate, believing Walt wouldn't care or react or even know about it until Jesse had already gone to the dealers. They were already waiting for him, Jesse gets gunned down and Gus consoles Walt after having the dealers killed by Mike for killing Tomas and causing the situation to begin with. Now Gus has Walt, his perfect lab and no more \"junkie\". Walt knew this, he figured it out and literally told Gus that hypothetically Jesse might have believed it was Gus' doing. The show writers wouldn't have Walt say this unless they wanted us to think about it. \n\nBut does that make Walt the good guy? Or Mike? No. Mike wanted to kill Jesse for a long time. He wanted to kill Jesse just for doing drugs after his girlfriend died. Literally told Walt, \"Let me take care of it\" intending to kill Jesse at a drug house when he was consumed with grief. The same Mike that we're supposed to believe saw Jesse as a son. \n\nOn the flip side, Mike figured Walt out and knew exactly what kind of man Walt was. Walt isn't a saint. He kept Jesse alive for his own selfish reasons. He used Jesse, manipulated him, took advantage of him. And let's not forget... Walt caused Jane to turn over and choke and then stood there while she choked. Walt is also the reason they got mixed up with Gus to begin with. \n\nHere's the list of garbage moves Walt made that caused Jesse's life to get progressively worse at every turn: \n\n1. When they were making cash hand over fist, Walt freaked out about Skinny Pete getting mugged which is absolutely a thing that dealers have to deal with. This put Jesse in a compromising situation for a wad of cash that they could easily make back on the back end. No retaliation is bad for business? You can retaliate in other ways. Black list those \"customers\" and they'll find a way to pay you back. Like Jesse said, they had the best product and no one else was dealing because Tuco was dead. \n\n2. After Jesse gets caught up in a situation that leads to a man's death, he starts getting cocky and pushes for them to expand. He tries to act like a know it all, pulling out a map and *teaching* Jesse, the one who is in charge of business, new areas to expand to. Jesse literally warns him that going into new territory will lead to violent encounters but Walt is happy to milk the MISBELIEF that Jesse killed Spooge even though he knows Jesse and his crew are no killers. At this point, they don't even have junior dealers working for Badger, Skinny Pete or Combo. \n\n3. Every single thing that Jesse warned Walt about happens. First, Badger gets arrested which costs them $80k to resolve. This also loses them a dealer. And then, disaster: Combo gets killed. Where? In new territory where Gus' dealers are. This means they're down two dealers and only have Skinny Pete. And he naturally wants out because Combo is dead. This also puts Jesse under tremendous stress which leads to him leaning heavily into drugs. Walt starts worrying about how they're going to sell 50 pounds of product, but he doesn't seem AT ALL worried about Jesse. He finagles a deal with a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy and manages to get a deal to sell all of his product to Gus. At this point, there's no doubt that Gus is most likely buying it just to get it off the market. \n\nThe entire reason they end up in business with Gus, the entire reason Combo was killed by Gus' dealers, the entire reason this whole business deal with Gus even starts is due to **WALT'S EGO**. His ego is also what led to them having their run-in with Tuco. Walt was angry about $1500-$2000 a day being too slow for him and wanted to sell to a distributor. Walt was angry about needing pseudo for a traditional cook so he concocted the plan to steal methylamine. Out of everyone, Gus and Walt are the only ones who didn't want to \"get out\" of the business. \n\nMike was a lot of things, and up until he finally warmed up to Jesse, he was a piece of shit in a lot of ways, but he wasn't in the business to be in the business. He was happy to get out ahead at various points in the series. Him and Jesse were willing to walk away, sell their shares of the methylamine and walk away with more money than they could've earned in a lifetime. But who wanted to stay? Walt. \n\nIt's easy to see Walt as the reasonable one who wanted to help Jesse.

{"original_topic": "breaking_bad", "comment": "Walter White: A Narcissist, But Not Entirely Looking for information, I\u2019ve seen tons of articles referring to Walter\u2019s narcissism, yet I haven\u2019t seen anyone mention a detail that could be relevant. Walter is not a narcissist from the start. Early in the series, he is shown as an empathetic man who loves his son. Some psychiatrists argue that at this point he is already a narcissist because he feels life owes him something\u2014a better job, making ends meet comfortably. I don\u2019t find this accurate, because this feeling is very human and it\u2019s exactly what makes us connect with him in the first place.\n\nPrimary narcissism arises as a response to childhood trauma and develops during adolescence. It is reinforced by individual traits, and empathy is either lost or severely damaged. Walter, rather, is in a state of emotional paralysis; his son\u2019s words hurt or scare him, and the circumstances of his life crush him.\n\nWalter\u2019s narcissism is secondary and, unlike primary narcissism, it is temporary. When Walter decides to \u201cchange,\u201d all the ego he had been suppressing for decades and his crippling sense of shame explode. Walter has no emotional tools to channel what is happening to him or to make a smooth transition of the self. All his resentment is released in every direction, and these narcissistic traits intensify more and more.\n\nArt imitates life. Many men (and some women), when living emotionally repressed lives and repeating traumatic patterns, become alcoholics, unfaithful, addicted to gambling\u2026 during a midlife crisis. Sometimes the trigger is illness, sometimes winning the lottery, or a meteoric career rise.", "timestamp": 1763736239, "label": "1"}

So I think most of you are aware that the show is scheduled to leave Netflix altogether in roughly a month.  \n\nI am running through the series, but I started about three months ago and am currently at the midway point of season 9.

But I have heard about two episodes that not only sound super interesting, but also get great IMDb ratings that I\u2019m really interested in watching:  \u201cScoobynatural\u201c and \u201cBaby.\u201d  Can I watch those right now, or at least very soon, and not be spoiling anything?  In other words, will I be able to watch it and enjoy/understand it without first burning through the series from where I am now?\n\nI appreciate the advice while avoiding spoilers from post season 9.   I\u2019m also open to recs of other great later episodes that stand on their own, though given the time restraints I would need to be picky to weed out the lesser stuff from the great ones. \n\nAlso, one last thing; it sucks that Netflix is losing the show.  But there may be a tiny sliver of hope in that it\u2019s been reported that Netflix is privately in communication with the owners of Warner Bros, which is up for sale.   They are interested in purchasing WB, but at this current stage they\u2019re just feeling out their options versus other potential buyers to see if it\u2019s feasible not only for themselves but for WB seller.  And of course, if they can purchase WB they would be outright getting the rights for Supernatural amongst their entire vast catalogue.  It probably won\u2019t happen soon, but it could still happen.

There's this episode, Azazel feeding demon blood to six-month old Sam, the woman in white basically force-kissing and abusing Sam in the pilot, Meg possessing Sam in S2E14, Ruby exploiting him with demon blood in season 4, the two hunters literally forcing demon blood down Sam's throat while physically restraining him in S5E3, that whole Becky plot in S7E8, and more.

Personal protection, small-scale interventions and inspire individuals.\n2. Archangels are divine messengers. They oversee large missions, interventions to Earth and spiritual battles. They are commanders of the Angels.\n3. Principalities guide groups of people/nations towards justice and peace. They protect entire nations, cities, and people. They also guide leaders and lead lower Angels.\n4. Powers are the Warrior-Angels. They combat evil spirits and maintain the spiritual balance of the cosmos. They oversee the boundary between the material and spiritual world. They guide souls and protect them.\n5. Virtues are the ones responsible for miracles, for channeling divine power into the natural world and maintain cosmic forces ( nature, elements, divine signs ). They also strengthen Humanity.\n6. Dominions regulate all lower angels. They ensure the Cosmos remains in harmony. They are the rulers of Heaven.\n7. Thrones embody divine justice, judgement and divine order. They serve as God's chariot. They ensure Angels follow the principle of justice and are humble.\n8. Cherubim. They are the guardians of divine knowledge and know of God's plan. They ensure the Angels are all wise, and gain insight into God's plan. They are the ones who guard the Garden of Eden.\n9. Seraphim. They are in the immediate presence of God.

{"original_topic": "supernatural", "comment": "Metatron vs Chuck Response I think Metatron was more understandable or relatable to most people in the fandom because his personification makes sense on a human level. He is not special. He is a dime a dozen. He is just one angel in a sea of angels pursuing an envied power, a power he perceived and coveted, to prove to an authority figure that he is special by proving it to everyone else. That he is better than everyone else. He is a pick me. If Metatron could look into Chuck\u2019s eyes and say the famous line from Meredith Grey to Derek Shepherd, pick me, choose me, love me, he would. That is exactly who Metatron is. A pick me. And many people identify with that. Not because I am calling them pick me\u2019s, but because many relate to the need to prove their worth to an authority figure, like a parental figure, by convincing everyone else first, often by cutting corners to do so. They cannot validate themselves unless that validation is reflected through the eyes of the authority.\n\n\nThe same idea can be found in some other villains in the show. Their motivations are dissected into digestible elements that allow watchers to recognize themselves in them. Lucifer, for instance, rebelled because his ego was wounded. His father punished him, grounded him, and in response he did everything under the sun to provoke him, as if to say, you hurt me, so I will hurt you back. Metatron, by contrast, did everything under the sun to finally be seen. To prove that he was not just the secretary, not merely stationed nearest to the door. He believed in a perceived closeness to Chuck and tried to amplify it to prove to everyone, and to himself, that he is worth something. That kind of longing is familiar to many.\n\n\nChuck and Amara, on the other hand, are not as easily understood. Amara\u2019s storyline helps you grasp her loneliness, but many missed that she was not driven by revenge. She was seeking an explanation. How Chuck could dare to lock her away when they are equals. No one else is their equal. No one else in the universe or the multiverse understands them. I saw many posts referring to Amara as a good person. She is not a person. She is not an understandable entity. Her power measures against existence itself. We have no means of knowing how she perceives anything.\n\n\nChuck removed the one being who stood on equal ground because he believed that without her, he could be absolute. What follows is a profound loneliness born from not being understood. No one knows exactly who he is or how he is. He can weave stories about being almighty, powerful, all seeing, but no one truly comprehends it. People interpret it in concepts they can process, but that does not mean they understand him. So he lives in a state of being completely alone and not fully grasped. Not misunderstood like a victim, simply not comprehended. And that was his choice.\n\n\nHe created the universe and the angels who believed in him and obeyed him. He became bored. It was too redundant, too predictable. So he created humanity and banished Lucifer. Even if he claimed it broke his heart and disappointed him, there was something slightly amusing in letting demons run loose on earth to see if it would spark something new. Humans still believed in him. But after years and eons, that too lost its novelty. He created a new multiverse. Nothing fit. Nothing met the unnamed expectation. He grew unhappy. Unhappy with his creations because they failed to deliver what he never truly articulated. He resembles a micromanaging boss who does not explain what he wants yet expects results, and when those results fall short, you are immediately seen as lesser.\n\n\nThat is who Chuck is. Someone who never really knew what he wanted. He thought total obedience was the answer. Then worship. Then chaos. None of it satisfied him. Until two small, seemingly insignificant creatures caught his attention. He found their resistance entertaining. No matter what he threw at them, they turned it into something meaningful. Their mother dies in flames on the ceiling, they live on the road, hunt monsters, grow up under a distant alcoholic father, and still they laugh, still they find resilience. He was fascinated. He raised the stakes again and again. He even stepped into their world personally to be near them.\n\n\nWhen he revealed himself, the illusion shattered. In one of their eyes he saw not awe, but defiance. In the other there was awe, but it slightly faded over time. It might not have been what he expected, it might not have been what he imagined, but it still became boring. And they had the audacity to take Lucifer\u2019s son, raise him, and become more emotionally connected to him than to Chuck himself. To him, that felt like betrayal. Sam even pulled the trigger on him. The very trigger Chuck gave them so the story could continue. In that moment he showed his hand too clearly, but it served as a conclusion, allowing the audience to understand where the arc was heading without delay.\n\n\nI do not believe he was poorly written as a villain. I think he was not given enough time to simmer properly as a villain. With Lucifer, for instance, we had several seasons before we reached the deeper layers of who he is and what drives him. With Chuck, everything was ultimately wrapped up in one season. It is understandable from a pacing point of view, but it did not feel developed enough in my eyes. Still, I fully believe the underlying idea that an entity with that kind of overwhelming power could reach that emotional and psychological conclusion. The journey to get there, however, was not sufficient to explain it clearly. Much of it happened across the entire timeline of creation and humanity, but it was not delivered in a way that was digestible or easy to follow.\n\n\nI also think a major opportunity was missed with Amara. They did not explore her further after freeing her from the cage and sending her off toward some sense of bliss. She could have provided grounding, a reference point for what it truly means to exist at that level of power. The hints about Chuck\u2019s motivations, his excitement about the Leviathans, the foreshadowing with the wolves, all of it felt less philosophically engaging than it should have been. Again, I think it comes down to not giving the storyline time to develop and breathe.\n\n\nWhen it comes to Sam and Dean, I think Chuck also wanted to express how important they were, how lucky they should have considered themselves to be acknowledged by him. The same way Metatron longed to be seen by Chuck, but in this case it was real. Metatron believed he was special because he served as the secretary, but as Chuck told him, he was simply the closest one to the door. Sam and Dean, however, genuinely caught his attention. He cared enough to watch them, to keep up with them, to move the storyline in ways that would allow them to rise to the moment. He even removed little inconveniences from their lives, such as health issues or trivial frustrations, so they could focus on what he wanted from them. Yet they never showed the appreciation he expected for that attention.\n\n\nI think that is because Sam and Dean never felt lesser. They always stood as tall as they could. To someone like Chuck, that could feel contradictory. It reminds me of when Dean spoke with Death in Chicago. Death told him he was just one small creature in one tiny galaxy, insignificant in his eyes, and compared it to an ant being defiant. And Chuck exceeds Death by magnitudes beyond that. So in Chuck\u2019s eyes, watching them defy him was almost laughable. At first it was amusing, but eventually it was not even that. When they persisted in standing against him, it was as if he thought, if you truly believe you can be something against me, then here. He destroyed everything and everyone and left them there to witness the scale of his power. As if to say, who are you to defy me? It is not even amusing anymore.", "timestamp": 1763736240, "label": "1"}
{"original_topic": "supernatural", "comment": "The Return That Shouldn't Have Happened: Mary Winchester Mary Winchester's return has always been one of the most controversial elements of Supernatural. Her death is the defining point of Sam and Dean's entire journey, and bringing her back ended up breaking much of the emotional weight the series had built up over the years. The problem wasn't just the return itself, but mainly the consequences that arose from it.\n\nWhen Mary returns, she ends up abandoning Sam and Dean again, but this time by her own choice. After decades of idealizing their mother, the brothers finally have the chance to meet her, but she decides to distance herself to \"rediscover herself,\" leaving behind sons who have spent their entire lives suffering from her absence. This not only reopens old wounds but creates new ones. For the Winchesters, their mother's return should have been a relief, but it becomes yet another source of pain.\n\nFurthermore, Mary returns and even allies herself with the British Men of Letters, a group that has always treated the Winchesters as disposable tools. For Sam and Dean, this was practically a betrayal. She approaches enemies who had already caused them serious problems and begins to follow orders that even put her own children at risk. The idea of a family reunion simply disappears.\n\nIn the end, Mary's return didn't bring unity, healing, or closure. It brought conflict, estrangement, and resentment. The Mary who returns isn't the loving figure Sam and Dean remembered, but a person full of traumas, insecurities, and attitudes that go against everything they stood for. This could have been interesting if it hadn't destroyed the emotional essence built by the series.\n\nIn short, Mary shouldn't have returned because her presence ended up undoing part of the emotional impact of the story, hurting her own children again and allying herself with people who have always been against the Winchester family. The promise was of an emotional reunion, but what happened was just more pain.", "timestamp": 1763736241, "label": "1"}

{"original_topic": "supernatural", "comment": "Chronologically Sound? So I think most of you are aware that the show is scheduled to leave Netflix altogether in roughly a month.  \n\nI am running through the series, but I started about three months ago and am currently at the midway point of season 9.  What I want to ask you guys is, I won\u2019t be able to finish the series in the time left mostly because I have a life and would need to watch multiple hours per day to finish it.  But I have heard about two episodes that not only sound super interesting, but also get great IMDb ratings that I\u2019m really interested in watching:  \u201cScoobynatural\u201c and \u201cBaby.\u201d  Can I watch those right now, or at least very soon, and not be spoiling anything?  In other words, will I be able to watch it and enjoy/understand it without first burning through the series from where I am now?\n\nI appreciate the advice while avoiding spoilers from post season 9.   I\u2019m also open to recs of other great later episodes that stand on their own, though given the time restraints I would need to be picky to weed out the lesser stuff from the great ones. \n\nAlso, one last thing; it sucks that Netflix is losing the show.  But there may be a tiny sliver of hope in that it\u2019s been reported that Netflix is privately in communication with the owners of Warner Bros, which is up for sale.   They are interested in purchasing WB, but at this current stage they\u2019re just feeling out their options versus other potential buyers to see if it\u2019s feasible not only for themselves but for WB seller.  And of course, if they can purchase WB they would be outright getting the rights for Supernatural amongst their entire vast catalogue.  It probably won\u2019t happen soon, but it could still happen.

They serve as God's chariot. They ensure Angels follow the principle of justice and are humble.\n8. Cherubim. They are the guardians of divine knowledge and know of God's plan. They ensure the Angels are all wise, and gain insight into God's plan. They are the ones who guard the Garden of Eden.\n9. Seraphim. They are in the immediate presence of God. They radiate God's divine love and light. They solely exist to praise God, to serve as the caretake of God's throne and they ignite love of God among lower angels.\n\nI think one can integrate them perfectly into Supernatural. Like yeah, you dont need all 9 types of Angels, so one can merge some groups. But the Seraphim would fit well into Chuck's character. Naomi is basically a Dominion. Gadreel would be a Cherubim.", "timestamp": 1763736241, "label": "1"}

{"original_topic": "wednesday", "comment": "I really wish Tyler and the other Hydes were written more like actual Jekyll-and-Hyde monsters Basically, exactly what the title says. A lot of the writing in this show is\u2026 let\u2019s call it \u201cwonky,\u201d and the show's lore suffers from it. The Alpha werewolf lore feels like it was made up in 5 minutes, and the Hyde lore isn\u2019t much better. The show dedicated two seasons to Hydes, and it still feels all over the place.\n\nHydes are clearly inspired by Robert Louis Stevenson's novella *The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde*. In the novella, Dr. Henry Jekyll develops a potion to separate his good and evil sides. When he drinks it, he transforms into evil Edward Hyde. Over time, Jekyll's transformations become more frequent and involuntary. The novella ends with Jekyll's final, unchangeable transformation into Hyde, who then commits suicide.\u00a0Throughout the story, Jekyll remembers everything he does as Hyde. Hyde is not a separate personality that takes over Jekyll's consciousness; rather, Hyde is Jekyll acting without his usual inhibitions, and Jekyll is fully aware of Hyde's actions. Essentially,\u00a0Jekyll tries to use the transformation to indulge in his darker impulses.\n\nThat\u2019s a very cool concept. And in Season 1, it seemed like the show was going in that direction. Tyler\u2019s first transformations are triggered by Laurel\u2019s chemicals. Maybe not at first, but over time, he becomes fully aware of his actions as a Hyde and starts enjoying them, because they give him the freedom to act on impulses he normally suppresses. That tracks with the original novella. But then the show adds lore that honestly makes everything messier: the **\u201cmaster\u201d**.\n\nAt first, I get it; writers needed a way to justify Laurel controlling Tyler and tie the twist together. Fine. But Season 2 introduces Tyler\u2019s mother, and suddenly the whole \u201cmaster\u201d concept becomes a narrative roadblock. So now apparently female Hydes don\u2019t need a master, only male Hydes do. BUT the master\u2019s control seems optional because Tyler kills Laurel and fights his own mother, AND male Hydes supposedly go \u201cinsane\u201d without a master, AND they still die young because each transformation shortens their lifespan. It really sucks being a male hyena. I mean Hyde.\n\nSo\u2026 what does a \u201cmaster\u201d even mean anymore?\n\nIt just feels *messy.* I wish they had stuck closer to the original Jekyll-and-Hyde idea rather than constantly adding plot-convenient rules that contradict earlier ones. And it\u2019s not just Hydes. The Alpha werewolf lore is equally vague and inconsistent.\n\nSeason 3 is going to expand the Hyde/werewolf lore even more with Capri and her mix of Hydes and werewolves, and honestly? I\u2019m scared that by the end of it, things are going to be even more convoluted than they already are, when they really don\u2019t need to be.\n\nAlso, as I was finishing typing all of this, I remembered that in Season 1, Xavier had some weird psychic connection to Tyler/Hyde, which the show never explained. But I guess we\u2019re never going to learn how or why that worked. Oh well\u2026\n\nJust some of my thoughts. What do you guys think about Hydes and how the show handles their lore?", "timestamp": 1763736241, "label": "1"}

{"original_topic": "wednesday", "comment": "Why Wenclair Doesn\u2019t Click for Me Anymore- as a huge fan of the ship after s1 I\u2019ve been trying really hard to figure out why Wenclair doesn\u2019t hit for me anymore, especially because I *want* to love them the way I did back in season one. I genuinely enjoyed their dynamic at first. Their contrast felt natural, their growth felt earned, and the whole \u201cOpessites attract\u201d trope actually worked really well. They had softness, tension, vulnerability, and all these tiny moments that made their connection feel warm and meaningful. I really believed in the version of them that season one was building.\n\nBut after S1, something changed for me, and it\u2019s been harder than I expected to reconnect with the ship. In season two, the relationship that hooked me just\u2026 wasn\u2019t there in the same way. They spent a lot of their scenes either arguing, miscommunicating, or being emotionally out of sync, and I never felt like the show gave them the time to rebuild or deepen the connection they started with. Even when they *did* have an emotional moment, like right before switching their bodies back, it didn\u2019t carry that same spark or weight from S1. It felt more like a leftover of what they used to be rather than a continuation of what they could\u2019ve become.\n\nI\u2019m not saying the writing was malicious or that the characters stopped caring about each other, but the shift in their dynamic made it harder for me to see the romantic potential that used to stand out so clearly. Instead of growing closer, it felt like they drifted apart, and the emotional thread between them got thinner instead of stronger. And when a ship relies heavily on chemistry, softness, and contrast, that shift really affects how you connect with it.\n\nI also want to be clear: this isn\u2019t an attack on Wenclair or the people who love it. I completely understand why the ship is meaningful to so many fans, and I think the version of Wenclair in season one was genuinely compelling. I\u2019m not trying to take that away from anyone. I\u2019m just being honest about my own experience: after S1, the show didn\u2019t give me the same feeling or energy that originally made me see their relationship in a romantic light.\n\nThe frustrating part is that I *wish* I still shipped it. I wish I could recapture that spark I felt the first time around. I wish I could go back to seeing what everyone else still sees. But the shift in how they were written in S2 changed the way I interpreted their dynamic, and no matter how much I try to get that old feeling back, I can\u2019t force it.\n\nSo this isn\u2019t a hate post, or a dismissal, or some superiority compex thing. It\u2019s just me admitting that the version of Wenclair I connected to isn\u2019t really present anymore, at least not for me. And I really wish that wasn\u2019t the case.", "timestamp": 1763736241, "label": "1"}

{"original_topic": "wednesday", "comment": "A Thought An idea, probably original, perhaps not, but how interesting a Telltale video game (if they hadn't gone bankrupt) based on Wednesday (the Netflix series) would have been. Her story is perfect for the Telltale style, in my opinion, as it shows Wednesday's gradual development. For now, I will limit myself to proposing only the first season.\nConcept:\nI would propose the typical Telltale style, so a point-and-click, but slightly less clunky and limited only to the investigation parts.\nPuzzles: In the investigative sections, an alternating use of powers and the investigation itself (maybe a bit more like Life is Strange). The puzzles will be of medium difficulty and, if solved, will advance the investigation.\nChoices: Clearly, in terms of interactions, there will be choices like any good Telltale game. They can be divided into good and bad choices. However, only certain choices will truly matter (for example, trusting Xavier or not).\nPlot: The plot will not be greatly distorted, but some things will change, and we will see soon.\nGameplay: Gameplay will only involve Wednesday, who will be the only playable character, while the rest will not be. What matters, as already mentioned, are the choices and the approach Wednesday has towards the investigations and her relationships with the various characters. In particular, the most important ones are: Enid, Xavier, Tyler, Thing, and Eugene. In addition to two other important factors: the family's opinion (Gomez, Morticia, Pugsley) and the academy's opinion (how the teachers see you).\nBased on the choices you make, you can have three different endings:\n1. Good Ending: Here, our Wednesday will act more with her heart than her head. That is, she will maintain a solid and lasting friendship with Enid. She will always trust Xavier, avoiding putting him in a bad light and preventing his arrest for being the Hyde. She will always support Eugene and help him gain more self-confidence. In terms of events, the final part will always be the same: Tyler betrays Wednesday, imprisons her, Crackstone awakens, and so on. What changes is who lives and who dies in the end. In the good ending, only Crackstone dies, while both Gates and Tyler are spared. In the end, everything is resolved, and the situation returns to normal. If you chose to trust Xavier, he will not leave but will remain at Nevermore, giving Wednesday the cell phone we saw him give towards the end of the TV season. In general, the family will have a positive opinion of our Wednesday, except Morticia, who will slightly criticize the sentimentality Wednesday acquired during this path. At a school level, the reputation will be at its maximum. Clearly, to obtain this ending, it will be necessary to have Enid at maximum trust (always acting kindly towards her). Clearly, all in pure Addams style.\n2. Neutral Ending: Identical to the first television season. It is obtained by acting neutrally on all fronts, except those impossible to modify. Crackstone dies, both other two villains live. In general, the relationship with Enid will be stable; Xavier will remain confident but will leave the school after having given the cell phone to Wednesday anyway. Here too, both other two aspects (family and school) will both be positive.\n3. Bad Ending: This is obtained only by making bad and generally wrong choices. In the end, all three villains will die. And in general, relationships will be negative, except for Enid, who will still remain by our side, albeit with less trust.\nOpinion Meter: Also important will be the Opinion\u2014the opinion Wednesday herself will have of herself and others. In general, the higher the opinion, the greater the possibility of having the good ending. If it is lower, the negative ending is more likely to be triggered.\nIn addition to the ending, there are also three different possible titles:\n\u2022 Hero: Obtainable only with the positive ending and always performing good deeds.\n\u2022 Savior: Obtainable with the default neutral ending OR can be obtained with the good ending but only if some events are failed or minor choices are missed.\n\u2022 Vigilante: Obtainable only with the bad ending.\nThe episodes will be eight, exactly like the television ones.\nI hope you like it, and if you have any suggestions, feel free to tell me.", "timestamp": 1763736242, "label": "1"}

We see a checkered floor, a circular light like the clock\u2019s hour markings and Isaac in the center getting a literal open-heart surgery to save his life.\n\nThen we go straight to the second image and there\u2026 if you don\u2019t see the connection, honestly you\u2019re not even trying \ud83d\ude09 Fine I\u2019ll explain for those who don\u2019t get it: we have the checkered floor (look at the third photo you can see it better with the red paint), a circular light like a clock and\u2026 yes you saw it\u2026 Tyler and Wednesday in the middle of the light....in the middle of a story\u2026 of the heart? I mean, please don\u2019t throw rocks at me it\u2019s not even me saying it it\u2019s the showrunners themselves ;) Anyway let\u2019s continue.\n\nIt\u2019s kinda crazy that it\u2019s the exact same structure twice right? And what are the symbolics linked to that? I\u2019ve already talked about it in my previous posts and so have other amazing contributors: chess (yes\u2026 again!) and the circular time\u2026 like the endless loop, the story repeating again\u2026\n\nAnd why did I think about the \u201cheart\u201d thing? Well I also remembered the very first scene Tyler and Wednesday have together. She repairs the coffee machine and she diagnoses a valve problem\u2026 yes a valve\u2026 you know just like heart valves\u2026 If I haven\u2019t convinced you well too bad I don\u2019t care. I like monologuing anyway.\n\nBut here comes my theory part which is actually always the same (sorry\u2026 well not really \ud83d\ude09): we\u2019re in a fu\\*\\*ing chess game that\u2019s been going on for at least two generations and honestly I think way more\u2026 And the Hydes are right at the center of the\u2026 thing?\u2026I mean Isaac wasn\u2019t a Hyde but his sister was and that was basically the fight of his whole life\u2026\n\nSo my prediction?  The Hydes are the pawns in a chess game but not just any pawns, in a way they are wanted, kept, controlled\u2026 right in the center of the game\u2026And at some point they are going to have to save Tyler like literally\u2026 from death\u2026 and break the cycle that keeps replaying forever\u2026 But who could take on that role?

I saw something again\u2026 Yeah yeah I know, you\u2019re all thinking \u201cyou\u2019re overanalyzing again\u2026\u201d Well yes, I fully own it, deal with it \ud83d\ude42\n\nSo anyway, this time I wanted to focus on the little animated sequence we see in Episode 1, the one about Isaac\u2019s story. And since Burton is behind it, I\u2019m assuming the details actually matter.\n\nI noticed a whole bunch of things in that animation, but because it\u2019s long, I\u2019m splitting it into two posts. So here we go!\n\nIn the first image, we see what are supposed to be Isaac\u2019s parents, the couple holding hands, and two doctors.\n\nI call them \u201cdoctors\u201d because both have stethoscopes around their necks, but honestly you could also see them as scientists. And the funny thing is, the only one with a slightly more humanized face is the one on the right...the one I\u2019m attributing to .... Augustus Stonehearst. The facial traits match, angular features, the nose proportions, the hairline\u2026 just younger obviously. And on top of that, with the story we already know, it pretty much confirms that this character really is Augustus. Honestly, it fits perfectly.\n\nSmall reminder, Isaac wants to save his sister Fran\u00e7oise from the Hyde curse. Stonehearst helps him and gives him access to a lab in the Iago Tower, but because he has his own hidden interest.... twisting Isaac\u2019s invention for his personal agenda\n\nNow here comes my theory part\u2026 you know, the one you all secretly enjoy \ud83d\ude09\n\nThere\u2019s a second scientist. Why? Just for decoration? They could\u2019ve shown the parents and Stonehearst...or they could\u2019ve even added Fran\u00e7oise in the drawing. But nope, they added another scientist \ud83d\udc40\n\nSo the only other scientist that comes to mind who\u2019s connected to Isaac and who we actually know is Matthew Sinclair, the science club president. And if Matthew Sinclair is connected to Enid, so potentially a wolf, then maybe he had a reason to want control over the wolf\u2026 or should I say\u2026 the alphas?\n\nThat could tie together Season 2 and Season 3, and maybe even future storylines, especially with the bronze wolf statue holding Fran\u00e7oise\u2019s Hyde body, which already hints at an Alpha\u2013Hyde connection.\n\nSo yeah\u2026 what do you think? Plausible?... Or maybe it\u2019s just for the symmetry of the drawing and I\u2019m imagining all of this\u2026\ud83d\ude09", "timestamp": 1763736242, "label": "0"}

As Dr. Fairburn told Wednesday, the last time Donovan saw Tyler was when he went to visit him at Willow Hill and Tyler snapped and went full hyde. \n\nDonovan was an awful father figure, hands down. And there is nothing that excuses the way he neglected his son, but there is a part of me that is bummed that we will never see those two have closure. If Donovan absolutely had to be killed off, I wish it would have occurred later on in the series. Him dying off rip at the start of season 2 felt like wasted character potential and just felt very rushed to me. \n\nDonovan put so much effort into investigating LOIS because he feared for his son's life, and I wish we got to see that more caring and protective fatherly side of him longer than we had. Even if Tyler never fully forgave Donovan for pulling away from him after Francoise' \"death\", I think it would have made for significant development for their relationship, but also for the growth of their characters individually.\n\nIt's very apparent that although their relationship was heavily strained, there was still love there.

As I\u2019ve always been a huge fan of \u201cHercules\u201d animated movie (1997) I couldn\u2019t help but notice that there are similarities between its plot and Wednesday, especially with regard to Tyler/Meg.\n\nFirst of all, Megara\u2019s character and arc remind me those of Tyler. Both are witty, sassy, with a great sense of humor, which, in fact, hides their vulnerability and pain. Both are lonely and longing for connection and love. Most importantly, both are used as a weapon against the main character but fall for him/her in the process of scheming.\n\nMegara suffered a broken heart before, she literally gave her soul to Hades to save her lover but he betrayed her leaving Meg as Hades\u2019s slave. Meg had no choice but to obey his orders. You may disagree and say that when Meg realizes she doesn\u2019t want to hurt Hercules anymore she refuses to do what Hades wants from her, but Hades turns Meg\u2019s feelings against her and uses her not only as his slave (\u201c*I own you!*\u201d) but also as a weapon against his nephew. So, she could do very little in these circumstances.\n\nTyler has even less autonomy than Meg. We still don\u2019t know how the things were from Tyler\u2019s POV (and maybe we\u2019ll never know) but when we talk about Hyde\u2019s master-slave relations in the series, we should not forget that Tyler couldn\u2019t even save himself from Wednesday\u2019s grip when his mother didn\u2019t allow him to transform into the Hyde. So that speaks volumes to me.\n\nNow, let\u2019s get back to Meg. Meg was the one who asked Hercules on a date, and it looks like she was the one who planned it to the last detail (restaurant by the bay and the play about Edipus \u2013 just like Tyler planned their date, decorated the place and found a true scary movie for Wednesday). Then, when they go for a stroll in the garden, they sit on the bench and, thanks to another Reddit user [**r/MovieDetails**](https://www.reddit.com/r/MovieDetails/), I got to know that this bench reminds us of Schola \u2013 semicircular tomb that was found in Pompeii. Tomb? Seriously?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9btwe1ons02g1.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=654e7d711f7495146794f43da921be7226cd7201\n\n[Schola in Pompeii. September 2021. Photo by Klaus Heese.](https://preview.redd.it/64tine0ws02g1.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fac172f1643206050fc90ecbbd21931048d2abbf)\n\nNow let\u2019s move to the most interesting part \u2013 the kiss. It goes like this:\n\n\\-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *Meg, I would never ever hurt you*\n\n\\-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *And I don\u2019t want to hurt you so let\u2019s both do ourselves a favor and\u2026 stop\u2026 this\u2026uhm\u2026before\u2026we\u2026*\n\nTheir eyes are closed, lips almost locked and then \u2013 BAM!\n\nPhil suddenly interrupts the kiss by blinding them with a flashlight shining on Pegasus' forehead.\n\nDoes it remind you of something? :D\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j3rpkgb5w02g1.jpg?width=500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1abcaa5193803745c94e0d1168cb1a9d548dfb74\n\nWhen Hercules departs, Meg is totally confused because of her mixed feelings \u2013 she knows she\u2019s falling in love with him but she doesn\u2019t want to admit it even to herself. However, in the end she gives in, and that leads both to her and Hercules\u2019s downfall because now Hades uses her as a bait and uncovers all the lies to the poor guy. By the way, Phil warned Hercules that there was something wrong with Meg - just like Xavier/Enid warned Wednesday about Tyler - but Hercules/Wednesday didn\u2019t want to listen because of his/her predisposition to Meg/Tyler. And it also led to uncovering the betrayal and two hearts being broken.\n\nSo, what\u2019s waiting for us in S3? We know how Hercules\u2019 and Meg\u2019s story ends. Meg sacrifices herself to save Hercules and he sacrifices himself to save her as well. Can we expect a similar redeeming arc for Tyler? I guess it will be more complex than that but who knows?

{"original_topic": "wednesday", "comment": "I really wish Tyler and the other Hydes were written more like actual Jekyll-and-Hyde monsters Basically, exactly what the title says. A lot of the writing in this show is\u2026 let\u2019s call it \u201cwonky,\u201d and the show's lore suffers from it. The Alpha werewolf lore feels like it was made up in 5 minutes, and the Hyde lore isn\u2019t much better. The show dedicated two seasons to Hydes, and it still feels all over the place.\n\nHydes are clearly inspired by Robert Louis Stevenson's novella *The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde*. In the novella, Dr. Henry Jekyll develops a potion to separate his good and evil sides. When he drinks it, he transforms into evil Edward Hyde. Over time, Jekyll's transformations become more frequent and involuntary. The novella ends with Jekyll's final, unchangeable transformation into Hyde, who then commits suicide.\u00a0Throughout the story, Jekyll remembers everything he does as Hyde. Hyde is not a separate personality that takes over Jekyll's consciousness; rather, Hyde is Jekyll acting without his usual inhibitions, and Jekyll is fully aware of Hyde's actions. Essentially,\u00a0Jekyll tries to use the transformation to indulge in his darker impulses.\n\nThat\u2019s a very cool concept. And in Season 1, it seemed like the show was going in that direction. Tyler\u2019s first transformations are triggered by Laurel\u2019s chemicals. Maybe not at first, but over time, he becomes fully aware of his actions as a Hyde and starts enjoying them, because they give him the freedom to act on impulses he normally suppresses. That tracks with the original novella. But then the show adds lore that honestly makes everything messier: the **\u201cmaster\u201d**.\n\nAt first, I get it; writers needed a way to justify Laurel controlling Tyler and tie the twist together. Fine. But Season 2 introduces Tyler\u2019s mother, and suddenly the whole \u201cmaster\u201d concept becomes a narrative roadblock. So now apparently female Hydes don\u2019t need a master, only male Hydes do. BUT the master\u2019s control seems optional because Tyler kills Laurel and fights his own mother, AND male Hydes supposedly go \u201cinsane\u201d without a master, AND they still die young because each transformation shortens their lifespan. It really sucks being a male hyena. I mean Hyde.\n\nSo\u2026 what does a \u201cmaster\u201d even mean anymore?\n\nIt just feels *messy.* I wish they had stuck closer to the original Jekyll-and-Hyde idea rather than constantly adding plot-convenient rules that contradict earlier ones. And it\u2019s not just Hydes. The Alpha werewolf lore is equally vague and inconsistent.\n\nSeason 3 is going to expand the Hyde/werewolf lore even more with Capri and her mix of Hydes and werewolves, and honestly? I\u2019m scared that by the end of it, things are going to be even more convoluted than they already are, when they really don\u2019t need to be.\n\nAlso, as I was finishing typing all of this, I remembered that in Season 1, Xavier had some weird psychic connection to Tyler/Hyde, which the show never explained. But I guess we\u2019re never going to learn how or why that worked. Oh well\u2026\n\nJust some of my thoughts. What do you guys think about Hydes and how the show handles their lore?", "timestamp": 1763736242, "label": "1"}

{"original_topic": "wednesday", "comment": "Why Wenclair Doesn\u2019t Click for Me Anymore- as a huge fan of the ship after s1 I\u2019ve been trying really hard to figure out why Wenclair doesn\u2019t hit for me anymore, especially because I *want* to love them the way I did back in season one. I genuinely enjoyed their dynamic at first. Their contrast felt natural, their growth felt earned, and the whole \u201cOpessites attract\u201d trope actually worked really well. They had softness, tension, vulnerability, and all these tiny moments that made their connection feel warm and meaningful. I really believed in the version of them that season one was building.\n\nBut after S1, something changed for me, and it\u2019s been harder than I expected to reconnect with the ship. In season two, the relationship that hooked me just\u2026 wasn\u2019t there in the same way. They spent a lot of their scenes either arguing, miscommunicating, or being emotionally out of sync, and I never felt like the show gave them the time to rebuild or deepen the connection they started with. Even when they *did* have an emotional moment, like right before switching their bodies back, it didn\u2019t carry that same spark or weight from S1. It felt more like a leftover of what they used to be rather than a continuation of what they could\u2019ve become.\n\nI\u2019m not saying the writing was malicious or that the characters stopped caring about each other, but the shift in their dynamic made it harder for me to see the romantic potential that used to stand out so clearly. Instead of growing closer, it felt like they drifted apart, and the emotional thread between them got thinner instead of stronger. And when a ship relies heavily on chemistry, softness, and contrast, that shift really affects how you connect with it.\n\nI also want to be clear: this isn\u2019t an attack on Wenclair or the people who love it. I completely understand why the ship is meaningful to so many fans, and I think the version of Wenclair in season one was genuinely compelling. I\u2019m not trying to take that away from anyone. I\u2019m just being honest about my own experience: after S1, the show didn\u2019t give me the same feeling or energy that originally made me see their relationship in a romantic light.\n\nThe frustrating part is that I *wish* I still shipped it. I wish I could recapture that spark I felt the first time around. I wish I could go back to seeing what everyone else still sees. But the shift in how they were written in S2 changed the way I interpreted their dynamic, and no matter how much I try to get that old feeling back, I can\u2019t force it.\n\nSo this isn\u2019t a hate post, or a dismissal, or some superiority compex thing. It\u2019s just me admitting that the version of Wenclair I connected to isn\u2019t really present anymore, at least not for me. And I really wish that wasn\u2019t the case.", "timestamp": 1763736242, "label": "1"}

{"original_topic": "wednesday", "comment": "A Thought An idea, probably original, perhaps not, but how interesting a Telltale video game (if they hadn't gone bankrupt) based on Wednesday (the Netflix series) would have been. Her story is perfect for the Telltale style, in my opinion, as it shows Wednesday's gradual development. For now, I will limit myself to proposing only the first season.\nConcept:\nI would propose the typical Telltale style, so a point-and-click, but slightly less clunky and limited only to the investigation parts.\nPuzzles: In the investigative sections, an alternating use of powers and the investigation itself (maybe a bit more like Life is Strange). The puzzles will be of medium difficulty and, if solved, will advance the investigation.\nChoices: Clearly, in terms of interactions, there will be choices like any good Telltale game. They can be divided into good and bad choices. However, only certain choices will truly matter (for example, trusting Xavier or not).\nPlot: The plot will not be greatly distorted, but some things will change, and we will see soon.\nGameplay: Gameplay will only involve Wednesday, who will be the only playable character, while the rest will not be. What matters, as already mentioned, are the choices and the approach Wednesday has towards the investigations and her relationships with the various characters. In particular, the most important ones are: Enid, Xavier, Tyler, Thing, and Eugene. In addition to two other important factors: the family's opinion (Gomez, Morticia, Pugsley) and the academy's opinion (how the teachers see you).\nBased on the choices you make, you can have three different endings:\n1. Good Ending: Here, our Wednesday will act more with her heart than her head. That is, she will maintain a solid and lasting friendship with Enid. She will always trust Xavier, avoiding putting him in a bad light and preventing his arrest for being the Hyde. She will always support Eugene and help him gain more self-confidence. In terms of events, the final part will always be the same: Tyler betrays Wednesday, imprisons her, Crackstone awakens, and so on. What changes is who lives and who dies in the end. In the good ending, only Crackstone dies, while both Gates and Tyler are spared. In the end, everything is resolved, and the situation returns to normal. If you chose to trust Xavier, he will not leave but will remain at Nevermore, giving Wednesday the cell phone we saw him give towards the end of the TV season. In general, the family will have a positive opinion of our Wednesday, except Morticia, who will slightly criticize the sentimentality Wednesday acquired during this path. At a school level, the reputation will be at its maximum. Clearly, to obtain this ending, it will be necessary to have Enid at maximum trust (always acting kindly towards her). Clearly, all in pure Addams style.\n2. Neutral Ending: Identical to the first television season. It is obtained by acting neutrally on all fronts, except those impossible to modify. Crackstone dies, both other two villains live. In general, the relationship with Enid will be stable; Xavier will remain confident but will leave the school after having given the cell phone to Wednesday anyway. Here too, both other two aspects (family and school) will both be positive.\n3. Bad Ending: This is obtained only by making bad and generally wrong choices. In the end, all three villains will die. And in general, relationships will be negative, except for Enid, who will still remain by our side, albeit with less trust.\nOpinion Meter: Also important will be the Opinion\u2014the opinion Wednesday herself will have of herself and others. In general, the higher the opinion, the greater the possibility of having the good ending. If it is lower, the negative ending is more likely to be triggered.\nIn addition to the ending, there are also three different possible titles:\n\u2022 Hero: Obtainable only with the positive ending and always performing good deeds.\n\u2022 Savior: Obtainable with the default neutral ending OR can be obtained with the good ending but only if some events are failed or minor choices are missed.\n\u2022 Vigilante: Obtainable only with the bad ending.\nThe episodes will be eight, exactly like the television ones.\nI hope you like it, and if you have any suggestions, feel free to tell me.", "timestamp": 1763736242, "label": "1"}

So this time we\u2019re going to focus mainly on the staging and\u2026 the symbolism of course\u2026 Yes yes I know it\u2019s totally me, can\u2019t change that \ud83d\ude09 Anyway let\u2019s analyze the first image. We see a checkered floor, a circular light like the clock\u2019s hour markings and Isaac in the center getting a literal open-heart surgery to save his life.\n\nThen we go straight to the second image and there\u2026 if you don\u2019t see the connection, honestly you\u2019re not even trying \ud83d\ude09 Fine I\u2019ll explain for those who don\u2019t get it: we have the checkered floor (look at the third photo you can see it better with the red paint), a circular light like a clock and\u2026 yes you saw it\u2026 Tyler and Wednesday in the middle of the light....in the middle of a story\u2026 of the heart? I mean, please don\u2019t throw rocks at me it\u2019s not even me saying it it\u2019s the showrunners themselves ;) Anyway let\u2019s continue.\n\nIt\u2019s kinda crazy that it\u2019s the exact same structure twice right? And what are the symbolics linked to that? I\u2019ve already talked about it in my previous posts and so have other amazing contributors: chess (yes\u2026 again!) and the circular time\u2026 like the endless loop, the story repeating again\u2026\n\nAnd why did I think about the \u201cheart\u201d thing? Well I also remembered the very first scene Tyler and Wednesday have together. She repairs the coffee machine and she diagnoses a valve problem\u2026 yes a valve\u2026 you know just like heart valves\u2026 If I haven\u2019t convinced you well too bad I don\u2019t care. I like monologuing anyway.\n\nBut here comes my theory part which is actually always the same (sorry\u2026 well not really \ud83d\ude09): we\u2019re in a fu\\*\\*ing chess game that\u2019s been going on for at least two generations and honestly I think way more\u2026 And the Hydes are right at the center of the\u2026 thing?\u2026I mean Isaac wasn\u2019t a Hyde but his sister was and that was basically the fight of his whole life\u2026\n\nSo my prediction?  The Hydes are the pawns in a chess game but not just any pawns, in a way they are wanted, kept, controlled\u2026 right in the center of the game\u2026And at some point they are going to have to save Tyler like literally\u2026 from death\u2026 and break the cycle that keeps replaying forever\u2026 But who could take on that role? Who? WHO?? Come on you have it on the tip of your tongue\u2026 We\u2026 We\u2026 Wednesday of course!\n\nSo? Your thoughts, your theories, your comments?

Here are the facts:\n\n1. **At the beginning of the school year**, he often tried to make eye contact with me. I\u2019m very shy, so I avoided it. Then, he started calling me *Baka* (a Japanese word for \"idiot\") discreetly, but I could clearly hear him.\n2. **As time went on, his behavior changed**. During a school trip, on the bus, he suddenly said: *\"Wesh \\[my name\\], how are you!?\"* Then, he kept looking at me. Every time I looked at him, he would look away, and when I turned back to the window, he would look at me again. This went on for a while until I got too embarrassed and turned completely away.\n3. **One day in class**, I was talking to his little sister (we\u2019ve become friends) a bit away from the group. When we decided to rejoin the others, he suddenly rushed towards my friend, stopped abruptly when he saw me, and then went back to his friends.\n4. **His little sister told me things about him**.

I replied a bit curtly (I regret it). My friend later told me that before I arrived, he was talking to his friend about wanting to focus on his projects, but as soon as I walked in, he asked me that question.\n6. **Recently, while I was handing out papers in class**, he suddenly turned towards me and whispered something to his friend.\n7. **Another time, he asked me:** *\"Are you going to defend me at the class council?\"* (I\u2019m just an eco-delegate and not involved in the class council).

During a school trip, on the bus, he suddenly said: *\"Wesh \\[my name\\], how are you!?\"* Then, he kept looking at me. Every time I looked at him, he would look away, and when I turned back to the window, he would look at me again. This went on for a while until I got too embarrassed and turned completely away.\n3. **One day in class**, I was talking to his little sister (we\u2019ve become friends) a bit away from the group. When we decided to rejoin the others, he suddenly rushed towards my friend, stopped abruptly when he saw me, and then went back to his friends.\n4. **His little sister told me things about him**. She said he talked about me at home, saying that at the beginning of the year, he had certain thoughts about me, but now it\u2019s better. He also said that I was nice and that I didn\u2019t talk to boys, which made me a \"good Muslim.\" He asked her not to tell me, but of course, she did.\n5. **One day, he asked if I was Moroccan**. I replied a bit curtly (I regret it). My friend later told me that before I arrived, he was talking to his friend about wanting to focus on his projects, but as soon as I walked in, he asked me that question.\n6. **Recently, while I was handing out papers in class**, he suddenly turned towards me and whispered something to his friend.\n7. **Another time, he asked me:** *\"Are you going to defend me at the class council?\"* (I\u2019m just an eco-delegate and not involved in the class council). Right after asking, he left without waiting for an answer.\n\nI\u2019m confused. He seems comfortable talking to other girls, but with me, he acts distant and ambiguous. Do you think he might be interested in me, or am I reading too much into this? How should I react?\n\nThank you in advance for your advice!\n\nAsk me questions if some points are not clear :)", "timestamp": 1763736243, "label": "0"}

{"original_topic": "adolescence", "comment": "Need advice about a boy at my school Hi,\n\nI\u2019m a 14-year-old girl, and I\u2019m new at my school. For a while now, I\u2019ve noticed that a boy in my class behaves in a certain way towards me, and I\u2019m not sure how to interpret it. Here are the facts:\n\n1. **At the beginning of the school year**, he often tried to make eye contact with me. I\u2019m very shy, so I avoided it. Then, he started calling me *Baka* (a Japanese word for \"idiot\") discreetly, but I could clearly hear him.\n2. **As time went on, his behavior changed**. During a school trip, on the bus, he suddenly said: *\"Wesh \\[my name\\], how are you!?\"* Then, he kept looking at me. Every time I looked at him, he would look away, and when I turned back to the window, he would look at me again. This went on for a while until I got too embarrassed and turned completely away.\n3. **One day in class**, I was talking to his little sister (we\u2019ve become friends) a bit away from the group. When we decided to rejoin the others, he suddenly rushed towards my friend, stopped abruptly when he saw me, and then went back to his friends.\n4. **His little sister told me things about him**. She said he talked about me at home, saying that at the beginning of the year, he had certain thoughts about me, but now it\u2019s better. He also said that I was nice and that I didn\u2019t talk to boys, which made me a \"good Muslim.\" He asked her not to tell me, but of course, she did.\n5. **One day, he asked if I was Moroccan**. I replied a bit curtly (I regret it). My friend later told me that before I arrived, he was talking to his friend about wanting to focus on his projects, but as soon as I walked in, he asked me that question.\n6. **Recently, while I was handing out papers in class**, he suddenly turned towards me and whispered something to his friend.\n7. **Another time, he asked me:** *\"Are you going to defend me at the class council?\"* (I\u2019m just an eco-delegate and not involved in the class council).

Polly sets up a deal with Lucca Changretta to have Tommy (and others) killed in exchange for Michael\u2019s life. Polly tells Michael of this plot but not that Tommy is in on it. This creates a moral dilemma for Michael: betray his mom to Tommy, or betray Tommy for his mom, eventually choosing to betray Tommy.

{"original_topic": "peaky_blinders", "comment": "I love watching interviews and listening to how they talk about the show and this story. Steven Knight:\n\nKnight also referenced  his  relationship in the Esquire interview, telling fans why Grace had to be killed off.\nHe said: \u201cIt was tempting to give him that sort of happiness with Grace.\n\u201cBut I just think if he ever finds happiness and contentment then the thing that makes him extraordinary will probably go away. \n\n\n\n\\-It shut him down emotionally?-\n \n\"During really horrific war situations, human beings change very quickly. Some part of the subconscious decides \u2018If you\u2019re going to survive, you\u2019ve got to be like this\u2019 so that\u2019s who you become \u2013 hard and brutal and all of those things that happen to soldiers. When Tommy got back, he couldn\u2019t stop that. He was frozen inside, like a lot of people who\u2019ve suffered the trauma of war.\nTommy was locked up and frozen inside for a long time. Then he met Grace and she changed things, she unlocked the doors a bit. Then as soon as that happens, it gets closed down again because she gets killed.\nWhat I keep doing with these characters is offering them a road to happiness and then blowing the bridge up and not letting them go down it. Polly too, would have been happy perhaps with Aberama, but then he\u2019s taken away from her as well.\"\n\n\n-Is there special significance to Grace\u2019s name?- \n\n\"Yes. She was exactly that, the old Puritan Christian concept of grace \u2013 whether you\u2019re good or not, sometimes somebody comes to you and saves you, even if you don\u2019t deserve it. The idea of an unearned saviour coming to save you is exactly what Grace was, and Tommy sort of didn\u2019t deserve it. Then she was taken away so he was thrown back.\"\n\n  \nCillian Murphy :\n\n\nTell us about Tommy\u2019s relationship with Grace\n\n\"He meets this girl who works in the pub and she gets to him. You begin to see the chink and the man that we would have known from before the war. It\u2019s a beautifully observed relationship because it happens very, very subtly and slowly - it\u2019s sort of a gradual defrosting between the two of them. It becomes quite intense over the course of the series. He has that fierce drive and ambition, and capacity for violence but also you see the other side of the man and the beauty of it is that he starts falling in love with this girl.\"\n\n  \n\" We meet him at the beginning of season 3\n you know he kind of ostensibly has\neverything that he could wish for you know certainly materially and you would expect emotionally because he now has you know the woman that he loves and he has a little baby and he has lived in this vast vast  mansion.\"\n\n\"Grace and the kid represent kind of the  purity in his life you know really and  then over the course of the season she gets stolen away from him and then  right the end the kid gets stolen away from him and so they kind of everything  that's pure in his life seems to be  under  trait throughout the course of this ser\u00edes.\"\n\n\n\" it's heartbroken,. she's such a fantastic character and  you know such a great time working with  Annabelle on the show and you know she  in one and two she kind of  altered to Tommy I think that light side of Tommy  that he left behind in the trenches and in France um was kind of reignited by her and I love the duality of the character because she is in  one hand a secret agente and then the other hand  you know\n a loving wife and she's a strong strong\n lady , Steven  write such strong women so yeah it's a bit of a  shocker to read it.\"\n\n  \n\" I think the pre-war Tommy used to smile a lot, he laughed a lot, he wanted to work with horses.\nHe was very romantic.\nAnd all of these things, you see scratches of them, you know,\nthroughout the show and there's times when he feels like he's getting towards some sort of healing when he's with Grace.\nAnd then it's taken away again.\nAnd then he retreats back into that kind of shell emotionally.\"\n\n  \nCillian Murphy agrees that Tommy Shelby was, and still is, beholden to the women in his life. \u201cAll the good stuff in Tommy comes, through his mother, from the Romany side. Polly\u2019s the one he trusts most. And he loves his sister, Ada, even though he\u2019s frustrated by her politics. His romantic relations are less straightforward.\u201d\n\nThat puts it mildly. In series one and two, Tommy swung between Irish secret agent Grace Burgess and horse-loving aristocrat May Carleton. No sooner did he marry Grace at the beginning of series three than she was murdered. Since then, he\u2019s had a go at orgies and erotic asphyxiation with Tatiana, a double-crossing White Russian, and enjoyed regular hook-ups with his brother John\u2019s ex-fianc\u00e9e, Lizzie Stark.\n\nMurphy takes a deep breath. \u201cRight,\u201d he says, \u201cduring the time Tommy was married to Grace he was completely faithful. Prior to that, sex was basically a way of self-medicating, then Grace\u2019s death spun him off into something else entirely. I think that as we meet him now, he\u2019s probably shut down again emotionally, and sex is just a physical need that has to be met.\u201d\n\n  \nThey are all different interviews.", "timestamp": 1763736244, "label": "1"}

I never got to watch it back when it first aired years ago, because the last season and the ending weren\u2019t even out yet during my initial run. But now, experiencing it all in one go? The season is absolutely insane in the best way possible.\n\nI keep seeing people in the subreddit and elsewhere saying that the show lost tension, emotional weight, or consistency in later seasons, and especially that the ending is widely hated. I honestly can\u2019t wrap my head around it. Season 7, for me, feels like some of the best material the series has ever produced. The writing, the pacing, the stakes it all comes together in such a wild, compelling way.\n\nSure, the ending leaves some questions and plots open. But I don\u2019t see Why that would be an issue. If youre actually listening and are open minded it\u2019s such a beautiful ending.\n\nThose who didn\u2019t like Season 7 or the ending, what about it specifically felt off to you? From my perspective, it\u2019s been a wild ride, and I\u2019m here for all of it.\n\n(And on a side note.. respect and love goes out to Jason Rothenberg.

{"original_topic": "wednesday", "comment": "I really wish Tyler and the other Hydes were written more like actual Jekyll-and-Hyde monsters Basically, exactly what the title says. A lot of the writing in this show is\u2026 let\u2019s call it \u201cwonky,\u201d and the show's lore suffers from it. The Alpha werewolf lore feels like it was made up in 5 minutes, and the Hyde lore isn\u2019t much better. The show dedicated two seasons to Hydes, and it still feels all over the place.\n\nHydes are clearly inspired by Robert Louis Stevenson's novella *The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde*. In the novella, Dr. Henry Jekyll develops a potion to separate his good and evil sides. When he drinks it, he transforms into evil Edward Hyde. Over time, Jekyll's transformations become more frequent and involuntary. The novella ends with Jekyll's final, unchangeable transformation into Hyde, who then commits suicide.\u00a0Throughout the story, Jekyll remembers everything he does as Hyde. Hyde is not a separate personality that takes over Jekyll's consciousness; rather, Hyde is Jekyll acting without his usual inhibitions, and Jekyll is fully aware of Hyde's actions. Essentially,\u00a0Jekyll tries to use the transformation to indulge in his darker impulses.\n\nThat\u2019s a very cool concept. And in Season 1, it seemed like the show was going in that direction. Tyler\u2019s first transformations are triggered by Laurel\u2019s chemicals. Maybe not at first, but over time, he becomes fully aware of his actions as a Hyde and starts enjoying them, because they give him the freedom to act on impulses he normally suppresses. That tracks with the original novella. But then the show adds lore that honestly makes everything messier: the **\u201cmaster\u201d**.\n\nAt first, I get it; writers needed a way to justify Laurel controlling Tyler and tie the twist together. Fine. But Season 2 introduces Tyler\u2019s mother, and suddenly the whole \u201cmaster\u201d concept becomes a narrative roadblock. So now apparently female Hydes don\u2019t need a master, only male Hydes do. BUT the master\u2019s control seems optional because Tyler kills Laurel and fights his own mother, AND male Hydes supposedly go \u201cinsane\u201d without a master, AND they still die young because each transformation shortens their lifespan. It really sucks being a male hyena. I mean Hyde.\n\nSo\u2026 what does a \u201cmaster\u201d even mean anymore?\n\nIt just feels *messy.* I wish they had stuck closer to the original Jekyll-and-Hyde idea rather than constantly adding plot-convenient rules that contradict earlier ones. And it\u2019s not just Hydes. The Alpha werewolf lore is equally vague and inconsistent.\n\nSeason 3 is going to expand the Hyde/werewolf lore even more with Capri and her mix of Hydes and werewolves, and honestly? I\u2019m scared that by the end of it, things are going to be even more convoluted than they already are, when they really don\u2019t need to be.\n\nAlso, as I was finishing typing all of this, I remembered that in Season 1, Xavier had some weird psychic connection to Tyler/Hyde, which the show never explained. But I guess we\u2019re never going to learn how or why that worked. Oh well\u2026\n\nJust some of my thoughts. What do you guys think about Hydes and how the show handles their lore?", "timestamp": 1763736372, "label": "1"}

{"original_topic": "wednesday", "comment": "Why Wenclair Doesn\u2019t Click for Me Anymore- as a huge fan of the ship after s1 I\u2019ve been trying really hard to figure out why Wenclair doesn\u2019t hit for me anymore, especially because I *want* to love them the way I did back in season one. I genuinely enjoyed their dynamic at first. Their contrast felt natural, their growth felt earned, and the whole \u201cOpessites attract\u201d trope actually worked really well. They had softness, tension, vulnerability, and all these tiny moments that made their connection feel warm and meaningful. I really believed in the version of them that season one was building.\n\nBut after S1, something changed for me, and it\u2019s been harder than I expected to reconnect with the ship. In season two, the relationship that hooked me just\u2026 wasn\u2019t there in the same way. They spent a lot of their scenes either arguing, miscommunicating, or being emotionally out of sync, and I never felt like the show gave them the time to rebuild or deepen the connection they started with. Even when they *did* have an emotional moment, like right before switching their bodies back, it didn\u2019t carry that same spark or weight from S1. It felt more like a leftover of what they used to be rather than a continuation of what they could\u2019ve become.\n\nI\u2019m not saying the writing was malicious or that the characters stopped caring about each other, but the shift in their dynamic made it harder for me to see the romantic potential that used to stand out so clearly. Instead of growing closer, it felt like they drifted apart, and the emotional thread between them got thinner instead of stronger. And when a ship relies heavily on chemistry, softness, and contrast, that shift really affects how you connect with it.\n\nI also want to be clear: this isn\u2019t an attack on Wenclair or the people who love it. I completely understand why the ship is meaningful to so many fans, and I think the version of Wenclair in season one was genuinely compelling. I\u2019m not trying to take that away from anyone. I\u2019m just being honest about my own experience: after S1, the show didn\u2019t give me the same feeling or energy that originally made me see their relationship in a romantic light.\n\nThe frustrating part is that I *wish* I still shipped it. I wish I could recapture that spark I felt the first time around. I wish I could go back to seeing what everyone else still sees. But the shift in how they were written in S2 changed the way I interpreted their dynamic, and no matter how much I try to get that old feeling back, I can\u2019t force it.\n\nSo this isn\u2019t a hate post, or a dismissal, or some superiority compex thing. It\u2019s just me admitting that the version of Wenclair I connected to isn\u2019t really present anymore, at least not for me. And I really wish that wasn\u2019t the case.", "timestamp": 1763736372, "label": "1"}

{"original_topic": "wednesday", "comment": "A Thought An idea, probably original, perhaps not, but how interesting a Telltale video game (if they hadn't gone bankrupt) based on Wednesday (the Netflix series) would have been. Her story is perfect for the Telltale style, in my opinion, as it shows Wednesday's gradual development. For now, I will limit myself to proposing only the first season.\nConcept:\nI would propose the typical Telltale style, so a point-and-click, but slightly less clunky and limited only to the investigation parts.\nPuzzles: In the investigative sections, an alternating use of powers and the investigation itself (maybe a bit more like Life is Strange). The puzzles will be of medium difficulty and, if solved, will advance the investigation.\nChoices: Clearly, in terms of interactions, there will be choices like any good Telltale game. They can be divided into good and bad choices. However, only certain choices will truly matter (for example, trusting Xavier or not).\nPlot: The plot will not be greatly distorted, but some things will change, and we will see soon.\nGameplay: Gameplay will only involve Wednesday, who will be the only playable character, while the rest will not be. What matters, as already mentioned, are the choices and the approach Wednesday has towards the investigations and her relationships with the various characters. In particular, the most important ones are: Enid, Xavier, Tyler, Thing, and Eugene. In addition to two other important factors: the family's opinion (Gomez, Morticia, Pugsley) and the academy's opinion (how the teachers see you).\nBased on the choices you make, you can have three different endings:\n1. Good Ending: Here, our Wednesday will act more with her heart than her head. That is, she will maintain a solid and lasting friendship with Enid. She will always trust Xavier, avoiding putting him in a bad light and preventing his arrest for being the Hyde. She will always support Eugene and help him gain more self-confidence. In terms of events, the final part will always be the same: Tyler betrays Wednesday, imprisons her, Crackstone awakens, and so on. What changes is who lives and who dies in the end. In the good ending, only Crackstone dies, while both Gates and Tyler are spared. In the end, everything is resolved, and the situation returns to normal. If you chose to trust Xavier, he will not leave but will remain at Nevermore, giving Wednesday the cell phone we saw him give towards the end of the TV season. In general, the family will have a positive opinion of our Wednesday, except Morticia, who will slightly criticize the sentimentality Wednesday acquired during this path. At a school level, the reputation will be at its maximum. Clearly, to obtain this ending, it will be necessary to have Enid at maximum trust (always acting kindly towards her). Clearly, all in pure Addams style.\n2. Neutral Ending: Identical to the first television season. It is obtained by acting neutrally on all fronts, except those impossible to modify. Crackstone dies, both other two villains live. In general, the relationship with Enid will be stable; Xavier will remain confident but will leave the school after having given the cell phone to Wednesday anyway. Here too, both other two aspects (family and school) will both be positive.\n3. Bad Ending: This is obtained only by making bad and generally wrong choices. In the end, all three villains will die. And in general, relationships will be negative, except for Enid, who will still remain by our side, albeit with less trust.\nOpinion Meter: Also important will be the Opinion\u2014the opinion Wednesday herself will have of herself and others. In general, the higher the opinion, the greater the possibility of having the good ending. If it is lower, the negative ending is more likely to be triggered.\nIn addition to the ending, there are also three different possible titles:\n\u2022 Hero: Obtainable only with the positive ending and always performing good deeds.\n\u2022 Savior: Obtainable with the default neutral ending OR can be obtained with the good ending but only if some events are failed or minor choices are missed.\n\u2022 Vigilante: Obtainable only with the bad ending.\nThe episodes will be eight, exactly like the television ones.\nI hope you like it, and if you have any suggestions, feel free to tell me.", "timestamp": 1763736372, "label": "1"}

And what are the symbolics linked to that? I\u2019ve already talked about it in my previous posts and so have other amazing contributors: chess (yes\u2026 again!) and the circular time\u2026 like the endless loop, the story repeating again\u2026\n\nAnd why did I think about the \u201cheart\u201d thing? Well I also remembered the very first scene Tyler and Wednesday have together. She repairs the coffee machine and she diagnoses a valve problem\u2026 yes a valve\u2026 you know just like heart valves\u2026 If I haven\u2019t convinced you well too bad I don\u2019t care. I like monologuing anyway.\n\nBut here comes my theory part which is actually always the same (sorry\u2026 well not really \ud83d\ude09): we\u2019re in a fu\\*\\*ing chess game that\u2019s been going on for at least two generations and honestly I think way more\u2026 And the Hydes are right at the center of the\u2026 thing?\u2026I mean Isaac wasn\u2019t a Hyde but his sister was and that was basically the fight of his whole life\u2026\n\nSo my prediction?  The Hydes are the pawns in a chess game but not just any pawns, in a way they are wanted, kept, controlled\u2026 right in the center of the game\u2026And at some point they are going to have to save Tyler like literally\u2026 from death\u2026 and break the cycle that keeps replaying forever\u2026 But who could take on that role?

And since Burton is behind it, I\u2019m assuming the details actually matter.\n\nI noticed a whole bunch of things in that animation, but because it\u2019s long, I\u2019m splitting it into two posts. So here we go!\n\nIn the first image, we see what are supposed to be Isaac\u2019s parents, the couple holding hands, and two doctors.\n\nI call them \u201cdoctors\u201d because both have stethoscopes around their necks, but honestly you could also see them as scientists. And the funny thing is, the only one with a slightly more humanized face is the one on the right...the one I\u2019m attributing to .... Augustus Stonehearst. The facial traits match, angular features, the nose proportions, the hairline\u2026 just younger obviously. And on top of that, with the story we already know, it pretty much confirms that this character really is Augustus. Honestly, it fits perfectly.\n\nSmall reminder, Isaac wants to save his sister Fran\u00e7oise from the Hyde curse. Stonehearst helps him and gives him access to a lab in the Iago Tower, but because he has his own hidden interest.... twisting Isaac\u2019s invention for his personal agenda\n\nNow here comes my theory part\u2026 you know, the one you all secretly enjoy \ud83d\ude09\n\nThere\u2019s a second scientist. Why? Just for decoration? They could\u2019ve shown the parents and Stonehearst...or they could\u2019ve even added Fran\u00e7oise in the drawing. But nope, they added another scientist \ud83d\udc40\n\nSo the only other scientist that comes to mind who\u2019s connected to Isaac and who we actually know is Matthew Sinclair, the science club president. And if Matthew Sinclair is connected to Enid, so potentially a wolf, then maybe he had a reason to want control over the wolf\u2026 or should I say\u2026 the alphas?\n\nThat could tie together Season 2 and Season 3, and maybe even future storylines, especially with the bronze wolf statue holding Fran\u00e7oise\u2019s Hyde body, which already hints at an Alpha\u2013Hyde connection.\n\nSo yeah\u2026 what do you think? Plausible?... Or maybe it\u2019s just for the symmetry of the drawing and I\u2019m imagining all of this\u2026\ud83d\ude09", "timestamp": 1763736372, "label": "0"}

As Dr. Fairburn told Wednesday, the last time Donovan saw Tyler was when he went to visit him at Willow Hill and Tyler snapped and went full hyde. \n\nDonovan was an awful father figure, hands down. And there is nothing that excuses the way he neglected his son, but there is a part of me that is bummed that we will never see those two have closure. If Donovan absolutely had to be killed off, I wish it would have occurred later on in the series. Him dying off rip at the start of season 2 felt like wasted character potential and just felt very rushed to me. \n\nDonovan put so much effort into investigating LOIS because he feared for his son's life, and I wish we got to see that more caring and protective fatherly side of him longer than we had. Even if Tyler never fully forgave Donovan for pulling away from him after Francoise' \"death\", I think it would have made for significant development for their relationship, but also for the growth of their characters individually.\n\nIt's very apparent that although their relationship was heavily strained, there was still love there.

As I\u2019ve always been a huge fan of \u201cHercules\u201d animated movie (1997) I couldn\u2019t help but notice that there are similarities between its plot and Wednesday, especially with regard to Tyler/Meg.\n\nFirst of all, Megara\u2019s character and arc remind me those of Tyler. Both are witty, sassy, with a great sense of humor, which, in fact, hides their vulnerability and pain. Both are lonely and longing for connection and love. Most importantly, both are used as a weapon against the main character but fall for him/her in the process of scheming.\n\nMegara suffered a broken heart before, she literally gave her soul to Hades to save her lover but he betrayed her leaving Meg as Hades\u2019s slave. Meg had no choice but to obey his orders. You may disagree and say that when Meg realizes she doesn\u2019t want to hurt Hercules anymore she refuses to do what Hades wants from her, but Hades turns Meg\u2019s feelings against her and uses her not only as his slave (\u201c*I own you!*\u201d) but also as a weapon against his nephew. So, she could do very little in these circumstances.\n\nTyler has even less autonomy than Meg. We still don\u2019t know how the things were from Tyler\u2019s POV (and maybe we\u2019ll never know) but when we talk about Hyde\u2019s master-slave relations in the series, we should not forget that Tyler couldn\u2019t even save himself from Wednesday\u2019s grip when his mother didn\u2019t allow him to transform into the Hyde. So that speaks volumes to me.\n\nNow, let\u2019s get back to Meg. Meg was the one who asked Hercules on a date, and it looks like she was the one who planned it to the last detail (restaurant by the bay and the play about Edipus \u2013 just like Tyler planned their date, decorated the place and found a true scary movie for Wednesday). Then, when they go for a stroll in the garden, they sit on the bench and, thanks to another Reddit user [**r/MovieDetails**](https://www.reddit.com/r/MovieDetails/), I got to know that this bench reminds us of Schola \u2013 semicircular tomb that was found in Pompeii. Tomb? Seriously?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9btwe1ons02g1.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=654e7d711f7495146794f43da921be7226cd7201\n\n[Schola in Pompeii. September 2021. Photo by Klaus Heese.](https://preview.redd.it/64tine0ws02g1.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fac172f1643206050fc90ecbbd21931048d2abbf)\n\nNow let\u2019s move to the most interesting part \u2013 the kiss. It goes like this:\n\n\\-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *Meg, I would never ever hurt you*\n\n\\-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *And I don\u2019t want to hurt you so let\u2019s both do ourselves a favor and\u2026 stop\u2026 this\u2026uhm\u2026before\u2026we\u2026*\n\nTheir eyes are closed, lips almost locked and then \u2013 BAM!\n\nPhil suddenly interrupts the kiss by blinding them with a flashlight shining on Pegasus' forehead.\n\nDoes it remind you of something? :D\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j3rpkgb5w02g1.jpg?width=500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1abcaa5193803745c94e0d1168cb1a9d548dfb74\n\nWhen Hercules departs, Meg is totally confused because of her mixed feelings \u2013 she knows she\u2019s falling in love with him but she doesn\u2019t want to admit it even to herself. However, in the end she gives in, and that leads both to her and Hercules\u2019s downfall because now Hades uses her as a bait and uncovers all the lies to the poor guy. By the way, Phil warned Hercules that there was something wrong with Meg - just like Xavier/Enid warned Wednesday about Tyler - but Hercules/Wednesday didn\u2019t want to listen because of his/her predisposition to Meg/Tyler. And it also led to uncovering the betrayal and two hearts being broken.\n\nSo, what\u2019s waiting for us in S3? We know how Hercules\u2019 and Meg\u2019s story ends. Meg sacrifices herself to save Hercules and he sacrifices himself to save her as well. Can we expect a similar redeeming arc for Tyler? I guess it will be more complex than that but who knows?

{"original_topic": "wednesday", "comment": "I really wish Tyler and the other Hydes were written more like actual Jekyll-and-Hyde monsters Basically, exactly what the title says. A lot of the writing in this show is\u2026 let\u2019s call it \u201cwonky,\u201d and the show's lore suffers from it. The Alpha werewolf lore feels like it was made up in 5 minutes, and the Hyde lore isn\u2019t much better. The show dedicated two seasons to Hydes, and it still feels all over the place.\n\nHydes are clearly inspired by Robert Louis Stevenson's novella *The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde*. In the novella, Dr. Henry Jekyll develops a potion to separate his good and evil sides. When he drinks it, he transforms into evil Edward Hyde. Over time, Jekyll's transformations become more frequent and involuntary. The novella ends with Jekyll's final, unchangeable transformation into Hyde, who then commits suicide.\u00a0Throughout the story, Jekyll remembers everything he does as Hyde. Hyde is not a separate personality that takes over Jekyll's consciousness; rather, Hyde is Jekyll acting without his usual inhibitions, and Jekyll is fully aware of Hyde's actions. Essentially,\u00a0Jekyll tries to use the transformation to indulge in his darker impulses.\n\nThat\u2019s a very cool concept. And in Season 1, it seemed like the show was going in that direction. Tyler\u2019s first transformations are triggered by Laurel\u2019s chemicals. Maybe not at first, but over time, he becomes fully aware of his actions as a Hyde and starts enjoying them, because they give him the freedom to act on impulses he normally suppresses. That tracks with the original novella. But then the show adds lore that honestly makes everything messier: the **\u201cmaster\u201d**.\n\nAt first, I get it; writers needed a way to justify Laurel controlling Tyler and tie the twist together. Fine. But Season 2 introduces Tyler\u2019s mother, and suddenly the whole \u201cmaster\u201d concept becomes a narrative roadblock. So now apparently female Hydes don\u2019t need a master, only male Hydes do. BUT the master\u2019s control seems optional because Tyler kills Laurel and fights his own mother, AND male Hydes supposedly go \u201cinsane\u201d without a master, AND they still die young because each transformation shortens their lifespan. It really sucks being a male hyena. I mean Hyde.\n\nSo\u2026 what does a \u201cmaster\u201d even mean anymore?\n\nIt just feels *messy.* I wish they had stuck closer to the original Jekyll-and-Hyde idea rather than constantly adding plot-convenient rules that contradict earlier ones. And it\u2019s not just Hydes. The Alpha werewolf lore is equally vague and inconsistent.\n\nSeason 3 is going to expand the Hyde/werewolf lore even more with Capri and her mix of Hydes and werewolves, and honestly? I\u2019m scared that by the end of it, things are going to be even more convoluted than they already are, when they really don\u2019t need to be.\n\nAlso, as I was finishing typing all of this, I remembered that in Season 1, Xavier had some weird psychic connection to Tyler/Hyde, which the show never explained. But I guess we\u2019re never going to learn how or why that worked. Oh well\u2026\n\nJust some of my thoughts. What do you guys think about Hydes and how the show handles their lore?", "timestamp": 1763736373, "label": "1"}

{"original_topic": "wednesday", "comment": "Why Wenclair Doesn\u2019t Click for Me Anymore- as a huge fan of the ship after s1 I\u2019ve been trying really hard to figure out why Wenclair doesn\u2019t hit for me anymore, especially because I *want* to love them the way I did back in season one. I genuinely enjoyed their dynamic at first. Their contrast felt natural, their growth felt earned, and the whole \u201cOpessites attract\u201d trope actually worked really well. They had softness, tension, vulnerability, and all these tiny moments that made their connection feel warm and meaningful. I really believed in the version of them that season one was building.\n\nBut after S1, something changed for me, and it\u2019s been harder than I expected to reconnect with the ship. In season two, the relationship that hooked me just\u2026 wasn\u2019t there in the same way. They spent a lot of their scenes either arguing, miscommunicating, or being emotionally out of sync, and I never felt like the show gave them the time to rebuild or deepen the connection they started with. Even when they *did* have an emotional moment, like right before switching their bodies back, it didn\u2019t carry that same spark or weight from S1. It felt more like a leftover of what they used to be rather than a continuation of what they could\u2019ve become.\n\nI\u2019m not saying the writing was malicious or that the characters stopped caring about each other, but the shift in their dynamic made it harder for me to see the romantic potential that used to stand out so clearly. Instead of growing closer, it felt like they drifted apart, and the emotional thread between them got thinner instead of stronger. And when a ship relies heavily on chemistry, softness, and contrast, that shift really affects how you connect with it.\n\nI also want to be clear: this isn\u2019t an attack on Wenclair or the people who love it. I completely understand why the ship is meaningful to so many fans, and I think the version of Wenclair in season one was genuinely compelling. I\u2019m not trying to take that away from anyone. I\u2019m just being honest about my own experience: after S1, the show didn\u2019t give me the same feeling or energy that originally made me see their relationship in a romantic light.\n\nThe frustrating part is that I *wish* I still shipped it. I wish I could recapture that spark I felt the first time around. I wish I could go back to seeing what everyone else still sees. But the shift in how they were written in S2 changed the way I interpreted their dynamic, and no matter how much I try to get that old feeling back, I can\u2019t force it.\n\nSo this isn\u2019t a hate post, or a dismissal, or some superiority compex thing. It\u2019s just me admitting that the version of Wenclair I connected to isn\u2019t really present anymore, at least not for me. And I really wish that wasn\u2019t the case.", "timestamp": 1763736373, "label": "1"}

{"original_topic": "wednesday", "comment": "A Thought An idea, probably original, perhaps not, but how interesting a Telltale video game (if they hadn't gone bankrupt) based on Wednesday (the Netflix series) would have been. Her story is perfect for the Telltale style, in my opinion, as it shows Wednesday's gradual development. For now, I will limit myself to proposing only the first season.\nConcept:\nI would propose the typical Telltale style, so a point-and-click, but slightly less clunky and limited only to the investigation parts.\nPuzzles: In the investigative sections, an alternating use of powers and the investigation itself (maybe a bit more like Life is Strange). The puzzles will be of medium difficulty and, if solved, will advance the investigation.\nChoices: Clearly, in terms of interactions, there will be choices like any good Telltale game. They can be divided into good and bad choices. However, only certain choices will truly matter (for example, trusting Xavier or not).\nPlot: The plot will not be greatly distorted, but some things will change, and we will see soon.\nGameplay: Gameplay will only involve Wednesday, who will be the only playable character, while the rest will not be. What matters, as already mentioned, are the choices and the approach Wednesday has towards the investigations and her relationships with the various characters. In particular, the most important ones are: Enid, Xavier, Tyler, Thing, and Eugene. In addition to two other important factors: the family's opinion (Gomez, Morticia, Pugsley) and the academy's opinion (how the teachers see you).\nBased on the choices you make, you can have three different endings:\n1. Good Ending: Here, our Wednesday will act more with her heart than her head. That is, she will maintain a solid and lasting friendship with Enid. She will always trust Xavier, avoiding putting him in a bad light and preventing his arrest for being the Hyde. She will always support Eugene and help him gain more self-confidence. In terms of events, the final part will always be the same: Tyler betrays Wednesday, imprisons her, Crackstone awakens, and so on. What changes is who lives and who dies in the end. In the good ending, only Crackstone dies, while both Gates and Tyler are spared. In the end, everything is resolved, and the situation returns to normal. If you chose to trust Xavier, he will not leave but will remain at Nevermore, giving Wednesday the cell phone we saw him give towards the end of the TV season. In general, the family will have a positive opinion of our Wednesday, except Morticia, who will slightly criticize the sentimentality Wednesday acquired during this path. At a school level, the reputation will be at its maximum. Clearly, to obtain this ending, it will be necessary to have Enid at maximum trust (always acting kindly towards her). Clearly, all in pure Addams style.\n2. Neutral Ending: Identical to the first television season. It is obtained by acting neutrally on all fronts, except those impossible to modify. Crackstone dies, both other two villains live. In general, the relationship with Enid will be stable; Xavier will remain confident but will leave the school after having given the cell phone to Wednesday anyway. Here too, both other two aspects (family and school) will both be positive.\n3. Bad Ending: This is obtained only by making bad and generally wrong choices. In the end, all three villains will die. And in general, relationships will be negative, except for Enid, who will still remain by our side, albeit with less trust.\nOpinion Meter: Also important will be the Opinion\u2014the opinion Wednesday herself will have of herself and others. In general, the higher the opinion, the greater the possibility of having the good ending. If it is lower, the negative ending is more likely to be triggered.\nIn addition to the ending, there are also three different possible titles:\n\u2022 Hero: Obtainable only with the positive ending and always performing good deeds.\n\u2022 Savior: Obtainable with the default neutral ending OR can be obtained with the good ending but only if some events are failed or minor choices are missed.\n\u2022 Vigilante: Obtainable only with the bad ending.\nThe episodes will be eight, exactly like the television ones.\nI hope you like it, and if you have any suggestions, feel free to tell me.", "timestamp": 1763736373, "label": "1"}

So this time we\u2019re going to focus mainly on the staging and\u2026 the symbolism of course\u2026 Yes yes I know it\u2019s totally me, can\u2019t change that \ud83d\ude09 Anyway let\u2019s analyze the first image. We see a checkered floor, a circular light like the clock\u2019s hour markings and Isaac in the center getting a literal open-heart surgery to save his life.\n\nThen we go straight to the second image and there\u2026 if you don\u2019t see the connection, honestly you\u2019re not even trying \ud83d\ude09 Fine I\u2019ll explain for those who don\u2019t get it: we have the checkered floor (look at the third photo you can see it better with the red paint), a circular light like a clock and\u2026 yes you saw it\u2026 Tyler and Wednesday in the middle of the light....in the middle of a story\u2026 of the heart? I mean, please don\u2019t throw rocks at me it\u2019s not even me saying it it\u2019s the showrunners themselves ;) Anyway let\u2019s continue.\n\nIt\u2019s kinda crazy that it\u2019s the exact same structure twice right? And what are the symbolics linked to that? I\u2019ve already talked about it in my previous posts and so have other amazing contributors: chess (yes\u2026 again!) and the circular time\u2026 like the endless loop, the story repeating again\u2026\n\nAnd why did I think about the \u201cheart\u201d thing? Well I also remembered the very first scene Tyler and Wednesday have together. She repairs the coffee machine and she diagnoses a valve problem\u2026 yes a valve\u2026 you know just like heart valves\u2026 If I haven\u2019t convinced you well too bad I don\u2019t care. I like monologuing anyway.\n\nBut here comes my theory part which is actually always the same (sorry\u2026 well not really \ud83d\ude09): we\u2019re in a fu\\*\\*ing chess game that\u2019s been going on for at least two generations and honestly I think way more\u2026 And the Hydes are right at the center of the\u2026 thing?\u2026I mean Isaac wasn\u2019t a Hyde but his sister was and that was basically the fight of his whole life\u2026\n\nSo my prediction?  The Hydes are the pawns in a chess game but not just any pawns, in a way they are wanted, kept, controlled\u2026 right in the center of the game\u2026And at some point they are going to have to save Tyler like literally\u2026 from death\u2026 and break the cycle that keeps replaying forever\u2026 But who could take on that role? Who? WHO?? Come on you have it on the tip of your tongue\u2026 We\u2026 We\u2026 Wednesday of course!\n\nSo? Your thoughts, your theories, your comments?

I honestly can\u2019t wrap my head around it. Season 7, for me, feels like some of the best material the series has ever produced. The writing, the pacing, the stakes it all comes together in such a wild, compelling way.\n\nSure, the ending leaves some questions and plots open. But I don\u2019t see Why that would be an issue. If youre actually listening and are open minded it\u2019s such a beautiful ending.\n\nThose who didn\u2019t like Season 7 or the ending, what about it specifically felt off to you?

I realize it is just me... but.  \n\nI really liked the story arc of Octavia and Indra, but hated the arc of Bellamy.  The way they handled Emori's death was sweet, and I understand that Murphy had to pay some sort of a price for his horrible mistakes.  Clarke's arc seems about right... But I do feel that she did everything for the betterment of her friends and her people... and killing the guy in front of the judge kind of seems forced. \n\n  \nThe ending I do not like.  I do like that her core people come back to be with her... but I don't like that they are ostracized and they can't repopulate.

I\u2019m also open to recs of other great later episodes that stand on their own, though given the time restraints I would need to be picky to weed out the lesser stuff from the great ones. \n\nAlso, one last thing; it sucks that Netflix is losing the show.

They are interested in purchasing WB, but at this current stage they\u2019re just feeling out their options versus other potential buyers to see if it\u2019s feasible not only for themselves but for WB seller.

They oversee the boundary between the material and spiritual world. They guide souls and protect them.\n5. Virtues are the ones responsible for miracles, for channeling divine power into the natural world and maintain cosmic forces ( nature, elements, divine signs ). They also strengthen Humanity.\n6. Dominions regulate all lower angels. They ensure the Cosmos remains in harmony. They are the rulers of Heaven.\n7. Thrones embody divine justice, judgement and divine order. They serve as God's chariot. They ensure Angels follow the principle of justice and are humble.\n8. Cherubim. They are the guardians of divine knowledge and know of God's plan. They ensure the Angels are all wise, and gain insight into God's plan. They are the ones who guard the Garden of Eden.\n9. Seraphim. They are in the immediate presence of God.

{"original_topic": "supernatural", "comment": "Metatron vs Chuck Response I think Metatron was more understandable or relatable to most people in the fandom because his personification makes sense on a human level. He is not special. He is a dime a dozen. He is just one angel in a sea of angels pursuing an envied power, a power he perceived and coveted, to prove to an authority figure that he is special by proving it to everyone else. That he is better than everyone else. He is a pick me. If Metatron could look into Chuck\u2019s eyes and say the famous line from Meredith Grey to Derek Shepherd, pick me, choose me, love me, he would. That is exactly who Metatron is. A pick me. And many people identify with that. Not because I am calling them pick me\u2019s, but because many relate to the need to prove their worth to an authority figure, like a parental figure, by convincing everyone else first, often by cutting corners to do so. They cannot validate themselves unless that validation is reflected through the eyes of the authority.\n\n\nThe same idea can be found in some other villains in the show. Their motivations are dissected into digestible elements that allow watchers to recognize themselves in them. Lucifer, for instance, rebelled because his ego was wounded. His father punished him, grounded him, and in response he did everything under the sun to provoke him, as if to say, you hurt me, so I will hurt you back. Metatron, by contrast, did everything under the sun to finally be seen. To prove that he was not just the secretary, not merely stationed nearest to the door. He believed in a perceived closeness to Chuck and tried to amplify it to prove to everyone, and to himself, that he is worth something. That kind of longing is familiar to many.\n\n\nChuck and Amara, on the other hand, are not as easily understood. Amara\u2019s storyline helps you grasp her loneliness, but many missed that she was not driven by revenge. She was seeking an explanation. How Chuck could dare to lock her away when they are equals. No one else is their equal. No one else in the universe or the multiverse understands them. I saw many posts referring to Amara as a good person. She is not a person. She is not an understandable entity. Her power measures against existence itself. We have no means of knowing how she perceives anything.\n\n\nChuck removed the one being who stood on equal ground because he believed that without her, he could be absolute. What follows is a profound loneliness born from not being understood. No one knows exactly who he is or how he is. He can weave stories about being almighty, powerful, all seeing, but no one truly comprehends it. People interpret it in concepts they can process, but that does not mean they understand him. So he lives in a state of being completely alone and not fully grasped. Not misunderstood like a victim, simply not comprehended. And that was his choice.\n\n\nHe created the universe and the angels who believed in him and obeyed him. He became bored. It was too redundant, too predictable. So he created humanity and banished Lucifer. Even if he claimed it broke his heart and disappointed him, there was something slightly amusing in letting demons run loose on earth to see if it would spark something new. Humans still believed in him. But after years and eons, that too lost its novelty. He created a new multiverse. Nothing fit. Nothing met the unnamed expectation. He grew unhappy. Unhappy with his creations because they failed to deliver what he never truly articulated. He resembles a micromanaging boss who does not explain what he wants yet expects results, and when those results fall short, you are immediately seen as lesser.\n\n\nThat is who Chuck is. Someone who never really knew what he wanted. He thought total obedience was the answer. Then worship. Then chaos. None of it satisfied him. Until two small, seemingly insignificant creatures caught his attention. He found their resistance entertaining. No matter what he threw at them, they turned it into something meaningful. Their mother dies in flames on the ceiling, they live on the road, hunt monsters, grow up under a distant alcoholic father, and still they laugh, still they find resilience. He was fascinated. He raised the stakes again and again. He even stepped into their world personally to be near them.\n\n\nWhen he revealed himself, the illusion shattered. In one of their eyes he saw not awe, but defiance. In the other there was awe, but it slightly faded over time. It might not have been what he expected, it might not have been what he imagined, but it still became boring. And they had the audacity to take Lucifer\u2019s son, raise him, and become more emotionally connected to him than to Chuck himself. To him, that felt like betrayal. Sam even pulled the trigger on him. The very trigger Chuck gave them so the story could continue. In that moment he showed his hand too clearly, but it served as a conclusion, allowing the audience to understand where the arc was heading without delay.\n\n\nI do not believe he was poorly written as a villain. I think he was not given enough time to simmer properly as a villain. With Lucifer, for instance, we had several seasons before we reached the deeper layers of who he is and what drives him. With Chuck, everything was ultimately wrapped up in one season. It is understandable from a pacing point of view, but it did not feel developed enough in my eyes. Still, I fully believe the underlying idea that an entity with that kind of overwhelming power could reach that emotional and psychological conclusion. The journey to get there, however, was not sufficient to explain it clearly. Much of it happened across the entire timeline of creation and humanity, but it was not delivered in a way that was digestible or easy to follow.\n\n\nI also think a major opportunity was missed with Amara. They did not explore her further after freeing her from the cage and sending her off toward some sense of bliss. She could have provided grounding, a reference point for what it truly means to exist at that level of power. The hints about Chuck\u2019s motivations, his excitement about the Leviathans, the foreshadowing with the wolves, all of it felt less philosophically engaging than it should have been. Again, I think it comes down to not giving the storyline time to develop and breathe.\n\n\nWhen it comes to Sam and Dean, I think Chuck also wanted to express how important they were, how lucky they should have considered themselves to be acknowledged by him. The same way Metatron longed to be seen by Chuck, but in this case it was real. Metatron believed he was special because he served as the secretary, but as Chuck told him, he was simply the closest one to the door. Sam and Dean, however, genuinely caught his attention. He cared enough to watch them, to keep up with them, to move the storyline in ways that would allow them to rise to the moment. He even removed little inconveniences from their lives, such as health issues or trivial frustrations, so they could focus on what he wanted from them. Yet they never showed the appreciation he expected for that attention.\n\n\nI think that is because Sam and Dean never felt lesser. They always stood as tall as they could. To someone like Chuck, that could feel contradictory. It reminds me of when Dean spoke with Death in Chicago. Death told him he was just one small creature in one tiny galaxy, insignificant in his eyes, and compared it to an ant being defiant. And Chuck exceeds Death by magnitudes beyond that. So in Chuck\u2019s eyes, watching them defy him was almost laughable. At first it was amusing, but eventually it was not even that. When they persisted in standing against him, it was as if he thought, if you truly believe you can be something against me, then here. He destroyed everything and everyone and left them there to witness the scale of his power. As if to say, who are you to defy me? It is not even amusing anymore.", "timestamp": 1763736374, "label": "1"}
{"original_topic": "supernatural", "comment": "The Return That Shouldn't Have Happened: Mary Winchester Mary Winchester's return has always been one of the most controversial elements of Supernatural. Her death is the defining point of Sam and Dean's entire journey, and bringing her back ended up breaking much of the emotional weight the series had built up over the years. The problem wasn't just the return itself, but mainly the consequences that arose from it.\n\nWhen Mary returns, she ends up abandoning Sam and Dean again, but this time by her own choice. After decades of idealizing their mother, the brothers finally have the chance to meet her, but she decides to distance herself to \"rediscover herself,\" leaving behind sons who have spent their entire lives suffering from her absence. This not only reopens old wounds but creates new ones. For the Winchesters, their mother's return should have been a relief, but it becomes yet another source of pain.\n\nFurthermore, Mary returns and even allies herself with the British Men of Letters, a group that has always treated the Winchesters as disposable tools. For Sam and Dean, this was practically a betrayal. She approaches enemies who had already caused them serious problems and begins to follow orders that even put her own children at risk. The idea of a family reunion simply disappears.\n\nIn the end, Mary's return didn't bring unity, healing, or closure. It brought conflict, estrangement, and resentment. The Mary who returns isn't the loving figure Sam and Dean remembered, but a person full of traumas, insecurities, and attitudes that go against everything they stood for. This could have been interesting if it hadn't destroyed the emotional essence built by the series.\n\nIn short, Mary shouldn't have returned because her presence ended up undoing part of the emotional impact of the story, hurting her own children again and allying herself with people who have always been against the Winchester family. The promise was of an emotional reunion, but what happened was just more pain.", "timestamp": 1763736374, "label": "1"}

So I think most of you are aware that the show is scheduled to leave Netflix altogether in roughly a month.  \n\nI am running through the series, but I started about three months ago and am currently at the midway point of season 9.  What I want to ask you guys is, I won\u2019t be able to finish the series in the time left mostly because I have a life and would need to watch multiple hours per day to finish it.  But I have heard about two episodes that not only sound super interesting, but also get great IMDb ratings that I\u2019m really interested in watching:  \u201cScoobynatural\u201c and \u201cBaby.\u201d  Can I watch those right now, or at least very soon, and not be spoiling anything?

I\u2019m also open to recs of other great later episodes that stand on their own, though given the time restraints I would need to be picky to weed out the lesser stuff from the great ones. \n\nAlso, one last thing; it sucks that Netflix is losing the show.

They are interested in purchasing WB, but at this current stage they\u2019re just feeling out their options versus other potential buyers to see if it\u2019s feasible not only for themselves but for WB seller.

So fleshing them out, would have worked out great.\n\n\\[ From lowest to highest \\] : \n\n1. Angels are the closest to humans. They may be guardian angels of humans and interact with them directly. Personal protection, small-scale interventions and inspire individuals.\n2. Archangels are divine messengers. They oversee large missions, interventions to Earth and spiritual battles. They are commanders of the Angels.\n3. Principalities guide groups of people/nations towards justice and peace. They protect entire nations, cities, and people. They also guide leaders and lead lower Angels.\n4. Powers are the Warrior-Angels. They combat evil spirits and maintain the spiritual balance of the cosmos. They oversee the boundary between the material and spiritual world. They guide souls and protect them.\n5. Virtues are the ones responsible for miracles, for channeling divine power into the natural world and maintain cosmic forces ( nature, elements, divine signs ). They also strengthen Humanity.\n6. Dominions regulate all lower angels. They ensure the Cosmos remains in harmony. They are the rulers of Heaven.\n7. Thrones embody divine justice, judgement and divine order. They serve as God's chariot. They ensure Angels follow the principle of justice and are humble.\n8. Cherubim. They are the guardians of divine knowledge and know of God's plan. They ensure the Angels are all wise, and gain insight into God's plan. They are the ones who guard the Garden of Eden.\n9. Seraphim. They are in the immediate presence of God. They radiate God's divine love and light. They solely exist to praise God, to serve as the caretake of God's throne and they ignite love of God among lower angels.\n\nI think one can integrate them perfectly into Supernatural. Like yeah, you dont need all 9 types of Angels, so one can merge some groups. But the Seraphim would fit well into Chuck's character. Naomi is basically a Dominion. Gadreel would be a Cherubim.", "timestamp": 1763736375, "label": "1"}

{"original_topic": "euphoria", "comment": "Euphoria really destroyed its potential Hey y\u2019all, so I was bored and decided to rewatch Euphoria, and dang guys season 1 is literally so peak. I really feel like Euphoria stands out from all these other high school dramas because the aesthetic and cinematography is just beautiful, not to mention that I also feel like the characters are super realistic (not so much the whole high school aspect because every one of these bitches would be dress coded in two seconds if it was the real world lol) but just the way the characters think and feel, I mean I\u2019m in college now but when season 1 first came out, I was a sophomore in high school and the characters were just so relatable to me.\n\nBut I\u2019m not gonna lie, Euphoria really just wasted away all of its potential with season 2 and how they\u2019re treating the release of season 3. First of all, season 2 was lowkey trash. There wasn\u2019t much in the way of character development or just overall storyline, and after rewatching season 2, it really just feels kind of dragged on. When the hype was going on for season 2, people treated this show like it could do no wrong and so did I, but now I really just feel like season 2 is pretty bad. Lexi\u2019s play was also so unnecessary, like I get that they were trying to show how she was coming out of her shell and stuff, but I feel like they could have done that in a much better way, we as the audience really didn\u2019t need a whole recap of the events of season 1 in a school play that would have never been allowed to exist in a real school. Outside of just the writing though, I mean these people have waited SO LONG to release the next season, it\u2019s gonna be 4 years by the time the new season comes out. I know there were unexpected deaths from the cast which is just a tragedy, but it\u2019s been so long and there\u2019s so many people missing in the show now that I feel like people aren\u2019t even excited about this show anymore, and they should lowkey just call it good, but of course they\u2019re gonna milk it financially for all that it\u2019s worth.

With rumors surrounding Cassie and Nate getting married in season 3 it\u2019s possible this might be a plot point.

{"original_topic": "euphoria", "comment": "Euphoria really destroyed its potential Hey y\u2019all, so I was bored and decided to rewatch Euphoria, and dang guys season 1 is literally so peak. I really feel like Euphoria stands out from all these other high school dramas because the aesthetic and cinematography is just beautiful, not to mention that I also feel like the characters are super realistic (not so much the whole high school aspect because every one of these bitches would be dress coded in two seconds if it was the real world lol) but just the way the characters think and feel, I mean I\u2019m in college now but when season 1 first came out, I was a sophomore in high school and the characters were just so relatable to me.\n\nBut I\u2019m not gonna lie, Euphoria really just wasted away all of its potential with season 2 and how they\u2019re treating the release of season 3. First of all, season 2 was lowkey trash. There wasn\u2019t much in the way of character development or just overall storyline, and after rewatching season 2, it really just feels kind of dragged on. When the hype was going on for season 2, people treated this show like it could do no wrong and so did I, but now I really just feel like season 2 is pretty bad. Lexi\u2019s play was also so unnecessary, like I get that they were trying to show how she was coming out of her shell and stuff, but I feel like they could have done that in a much better way, we as the audience really didn\u2019t need a whole recap of the events of season 1 in a school play that would have never been allowed to exist in a real school. Outside of just the writing though, I mean these people have waited SO LONG to release the next season, it\u2019s gonna be 4 years by the time the new season comes out. I know there were unexpected deaths from the cast which is just a tragedy, but it\u2019s been so long and there\u2019s so many people missing in the show now that I feel like people aren\u2019t even excited about this show anymore, and they should lowkey just call it good, but of course they\u2019re gonna milk it financially for all that it\u2019s worth. It just kind of sucks because season 1 had the potential to make the show the best modern teen drama ever made, yet it failed so miserably.", "timestamp": 1763736376, "label": "0"}

Then, he started calling me *Baka* (a Japanese word for \"idiot\") discreetly, but I could clearly hear him.\n2. **As time went on, his behavior changed**. During a school trip, on the bus, he suddenly said: *\"Wesh \\[my name\\], how are you!?\"* Then, he kept looking at me. Every time I looked at him, he would look away, and when I turned back to the window, he would look at me again. This went on for a while until I got too embarrassed and turned completely away.\n3. **One day in class**, I was talking to his little sister (we\u2019ve become friends) a bit away from the group.

I replied a bit curtly (I regret it). My friend later told me that before I arrived, he was talking to his friend about wanting to focus on his projects, but as soon as I walked in, he asked me that question.\n6. **Recently, while I was handing out papers in class**, he suddenly turned towards me and whispered something to his friend.\n7. **Another time, he asked me:** *\"Are you going to defend me at the class council?\"* (I\u2019m just an eco-delegate and not involved in the class council). Right after asking, he left without waiting for an answer.\n\nI\u2019m confused. He seems comfortable talking to other girls, but with me, he acts distant and ambiguous.

For a while now, I\u2019ve noticed that a boy in my class behaves in a certain way towards me, and I\u2019m not sure how to interpret it. Here are the facts:\n\n1. **At the beginning of the school year**, he often tried to make eye contact with me. I\u2019m very shy, so I avoided it. Then, he started calling me *Baka* (a Japanese word for \"idiot\") discreetly, but I could clearly hear him.\n2. **As time went on, his behavior changed**. During a school trip, on the bus, he suddenly said: *\"Wesh \\[my name\\], how are you!?\"* Then, he kept looking at me. Every time I looked at him, he would look away, and when I turned back to the window, he would look at me again. This went on for a while until I got too embarrassed and turned completely away.\n3. **One day in class**, I was talking to his little sister (we\u2019ve become friends) a bit away from the group. When we decided to rejoin the others, he suddenly rushed towards my friend, stopped abruptly when he saw me, and then went back to his friends.\n4. **His little sister told me things about him**. She said he talked about me at home, saying that at the beginning of the year, he had certain thoughts about me, but now it\u2019s better. He also said that I was nice and that I didn\u2019t talk to boys, which made me a \"good Muslim.\" He asked her not to tell me, but of course, she did.\n5. **One day, he asked if I was Moroccan**. I replied a bit curtly (I regret it). My friend later told me that before I arrived, he was talking to his friend about wanting to focus on his projects, but as soon as I walked in, he asked me that question.\n6. **Recently, while I was handing out papers in class**, he suddenly turned towards me and whispered something to his friend.\n7. **Another time, he asked me:** *\"Are you going to defend me at the class council?\"* (I\u2019m just an eco-delegate and not involved in the class council). Right after asking, he left without waiting for an answer.\n\nI\u2019m confused. He seems comfortable talking to other girls, but with me, he acts distant and ambiguous.

{"original_topic": "breaking_bad", "comment": "Daily reminder that neither Mike nor Walt were \"right\" or \"wrong\", they were both pretty terrible people I saw a post yesterday about how Mike was wrong in his argument against Walt about how they had a good thing and Walt blew it up. I actually don't disagree with everything said about Mike's \"points\". I agree with a lot of it. \n\nI think Gus had Tomas murdered or at least knew that's what the dealers would do. Think about it. Gus' big thing is that his people don't operate without his consent or knowledge. Gus liked these dealers so much, he risked his relationship with Walt to protect them. There's no way they did that without Gus having at least mild knowledge of it. I think it was a play to get Jesse killed. Jesse goes to retaliate, believing Walt wouldn't care or react or even know about it until Jesse had already gone to the dealers. They were already waiting for him, Jesse gets gunned down and Gus consoles Walt after having the dealers killed by Mike for killing Tomas and causing the situation to begin with. Now Gus has Walt, his perfect lab and no more \"junkie\". Walt knew this, he figured it out and literally told Gus that hypothetically Jesse might have believed it was Gus' doing. The show writers wouldn't have Walt say this unless they wanted us to think about it. \n\nBut does that make Walt the good guy? Or Mike? No. Mike wanted to kill Jesse for a long time. He wanted to kill Jesse just for doing drugs after his girlfriend died. Literally told Walt, \"Let me take care of it\" intending to kill Jesse at a drug house when he was consumed with grief. The same Mike that we're supposed to believe saw Jesse as a son. \n\nOn the flip side, Mike figured Walt out and knew exactly what kind of man Walt was. Walt isn't a saint. He kept Jesse alive for his own selfish reasons. He used Jesse, manipulated him, took advantage of him. And let's not forget... Walt caused Jane to turn over and choke and then stood there while she choked. Walt is also the reason they got mixed up with Gus to begin with. \n\nHere's the list of garbage moves Walt made that caused Jesse's life to get progressively worse at every turn: \n\n1. When they were making cash hand over fist, Walt freaked out about Skinny Pete getting mugged which is absolutely a thing that dealers have to deal with. This put Jesse in a compromising situation for a wad of cash that they could easily make back on the back end. No retaliation is bad for business? You can retaliate in other ways. Black list those \"customers\" and they'll find a way to pay you back. Like Jesse said, they had the best product and no one else was dealing because Tuco was dead. \n\n2. After Jesse gets caught up in a situation that leads to a man's death, he starts getting cocky and pushes for them to expand. He tries to act like a know it all, pulling out a map and *teaching* Jesse, the one who is in charge of business, new areas to expand to. Jesse literally warns him that going into new territory will lead to violent encounters but Walt is happy to milk the MISBELIEF that Jesse killed Spooge even though he knows Jesse and his crew are no killers. At this point, they don't even have junior dealers working for Badger, Skinny Pete or Combo. \n\n3. Every single thing that Jesse warned Walt about happens. First, Badger gets arrested which costs them $80k to resolve. This also loses them a dealer. And then, disaster: Combo gets killed. Where? In new territory where Gus' dealers are. This means they're down two dealers and only have Skinny Pete. And he naturally wants out because Combo is dead. This also puts Jesse under tremendous stress which leads to him leaning heavily into drugs. Walt starts worrying about how they're going to sell 50 pounds of product, but he doesn't seem AT ALL worried about Jesse. He finagles a deal with a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy and manages to get a deal to sell all of his product to Gus. At this point, there's no doubt that Gus is most likely buying it just to get it off the market. \n\nThe entire reason they end up in business with Gus, the entire reason Combo was killed by Gus' dealers, the entire reason this whole business deal with Gus even starts is due to **WALT'S EGO**. His ego is also what led to them having their run-in with Tuco. Walt was angry about $1500-$2000 a day being too slow for him and wanted to sell to a distributor. Walt was angry about needing pseudo for a traditional cook so he concocted the plan to steal methylamine. Out of everyone, Gus and Walt are the only ones who didn't want to \"get out\" of the business. \n\nMike was a lot of things, and up until he finally warmed up to Jesse, he was a piece of shit in a lot of ways, but he wasn't in the business to be in the business. He was happy to get out ahead at various points in the series. Him and Jesse were willing to walk away, sell their shares of the methylamine and walk away with more money than they could've earned in a lifetime. But who wanted to stay? Walt. \n\nIt's easy to see Walt as the reasonable one who wanted to help Jesse. But it's important to understand that almost every time Walt \"saved\" Jesse, he was saving Jesse from a horrible situation that **he himself** put Jesse in.", "timestamp": 1763736377, "label": "0"}

{"original_topic": "breaking_bad", "comment": "Majority of the show happened in 1 year - and that's actually pretty realistic As most fans have figured that the majority of Breaking Bad happened in 2 years - with one year covering the first 4 seasons and first 3 episodes of season 5 and the remaining year was 13 episodes - some have said that this timeline is ridiculously unrealistic, but IMO it makes total sense, especially during binge watches. \n\nFrom my real life experiences, a lot can happen in one year, and sometimes 3-4 years and nothing changes besides that your best friend broke up with his girlfriend or your local Los Pollos joint gets shut down. It's all relative and based on perspectives. The same way people didn't know that the Beatles' discography only lasted about 7 years, because each album/image of the band was so different from one another.\n\n Breaking Bad happens to have a lot of events and multiple perspectives told through a lot of characters (who evolve a lot throughout the course of the series) with depths to them.

{"original_topic": "breaking_bad", "comment": "Walter White: A Narcissist, But Not Entirely Looking for information, I\u2019ve seen tons of articles referring to Walter\u2019s narcissism, yet I haven\u2019t seen anyone mention a detail that could be relevant. Walter is not a narcissist from the start. Early in the series, he is shown as an empathetic man who loves his son. Some psychiatrists argue that at this point he is already a narcissist because he feels life owes him something\u2014a better job, making ends meet comfortably. I don\u2019t find this accurate, because this feeling is very human and it\u2019s exactly what makes us connect with him in the first place.\n\nPrimary narcissism arises as a response to childhood trauma and develops during adolescence. It is reinforced by individual traits, and empathy is either lost or severely damaged. Walter, rather, is in a state of emotional paralysis; his son\u2019s words hurt or scare him, and the circumstances of his life crush him.\n\nWalter\u2019s narcissism is secondary and, unlike primary narcissism, it is temporary. When Walter decides to \u201cchange,\u201d all the ego he had been suppressing for decades and his crippling sense of shame explode. Walter has no emotional tools to channel what is happening to him or to make a smooth transition of the self. All his resentment is released in every direction, and these narcissistic traits intensify more and more.\n\nArt imitates life. Many men (and some women), when living emotionally repressed lives and repeating traumatic patterns, become alcoholics, unfaithful, addicted to gambling\u2026 during a midlife crisis. Sometimes the trigger is illness, sometimes winning the lottery, or a meteoric career rise.", "timestamp": 1763736377, "label": "1"}

Complications do happen, and sometimes it inevitable and comes at a high price. But good management and strategy is the way to accumulate these sudden complications without effecting the business flow too much. \n\nAnd to me, even though paying Mike\u2019s 9 guys were necessary (before they knew of the list and a killing plan), Mike \u201ctelling\u201d them about this cost at the \u201cvery last\u201d was very unprofessional. I would understand why Walt would be pissed, especially that 1. It was more expensive than the mules and 2. It was announced like it came out of nowhere. \n\nWalt was already pissed and greedy of paying 20% of 1.3 million for the mules (which was about 250k-300k in total, taking 80k-100k from each pile), you don\u2019t think Walt would even more pissed to pay for people who are not directly involved with their current venture that cost more than the mules that they paid (which was 357k, taking 117k from each pile)\n\nTo my understanding, if it\u2019s not professional Mike was concerned about, I think Mike said the legacy costs last to spite Walter of his consequences.  There was a post asking who was right about legacy costs.

{"original_topic": "breaking_bad", "comment": "I would like to defend Walter H. White from Mike's vicious character assassination. In Season 5 while involved in an argument with Walter - an argument which Walt admittedly ends up overreacting to - Mike says the following:\n\n\"We had a good thing you stupid son of a bitch. We had Fring. We had a lab. We had everything we needed and it all ran like clockwork. You could have shut your mouth, cooked, and made as much money as you ever needed. It was perfect. But no, you just had to blow it up. You and your pride and your ego. You just had to be the man. If you'd done your job, known your place, we'd all be fine right now.\"\n\nA lot of people in the fanbase celebrate this little speech from Mike, treating it as an epic takedown of Walt and talking as if it perfectly describes what happened between Walt and Gus.\n\nBut it doesn't! Walt's ego and pride had pretty much nothing to do with his falling out with Gus. Gus and Jesse's actions were the main drivers of the conflict - you could argue that Jesse was only involved to begin with because Walt insisted on it instead of \"shutting up and cooking\" but I think this is a real reach. Let's review what happened:\n\n1. Jesse discovered that the younger brother of a young woman he recently started a relationship with murdered his friend Combo, having been ordered to by a couple of dealers. He finds that these dealers work for Gus.\n\n2. Jesse begins plotting to kill the two dealers by poisoning them. Walt is concerned by this and after failing to talk Jesse down he instead tries to hatch a scheme with Saul to get Jesse arrested and take him off the streets so he can cool down. Gus finds out about this through Mike and then has Mike kidnap Jesse and bring him to a room to talk - in other words, Walt is the one trying hard to de-escalate the situation and Gus even makes it clear to Jesse that Walt is the only reason Gus didn't have him killed.\n\n3. After some back and forth, Gus agrees that he'll no longer use children in his operations in exchange for Jesse (very begrudgingly) agreeing to make peace with the dealers. Walt tries to make peace with Jesse but Jesse is still angry. At this point Walt has remained very calm and sensible the whole way, actively trying to avoid conflict with Gus.\n\n4. Shortly after, Jesse finds out that the kid Tom\u00e1s was murdered by the two dealers (Gus later claims that he did not know about this but we don't know for sure) and immediately resumes his murder plot against the two dealers.\n\n5. Wanting to protect Jesse, Walt instead kills the two dealers himself as he knows that he's more valuable than Jesse and Gus will be more reluctant to kill him than Jesse.\n\n6. Gus is very angry at this point and wants to kill Jesse. Walt **strongly suggests to Gus that he let it go, allow Jesse to skip town without pursuing him and he'll resume cooking.** Gus reluctantly agrees and reappoints Gale as Walt's new assistant.\n\n7. Although Gus agreed to move on, he has Victor monitor Walt very closely (showing clearly to Walt that he hasn't moved on) **and begins plotting to kill Walt and replace him with Gale.**\n\n8. Walt and Jesse realise that Gus is not going to let the whole thing go and that their only option for survival is to kill Gale. He's willing to do this only for self-preservation, because Gus will kill him and Jesse if he doesn't.\n\n9. Mike kidnaps Walter and takes him to the lab to execute him. Jesse manages to kill Gale first and so Gus is forced to keep Walt and Jesse alive so they can continue cooking.\n\n10. For some time after this a delicate truce is reached in which Gus has no choice but to keep Walt and Jesse alive so they can cook while Walt and Jesse know that the only thing keeping them alive is that they continue cooking. Admittedly Walt becomes increasingly paranoid and starts to behave erratically during this time and plots to kill Gus, but his paranoia turns out to be justified as Gus begins grooming Jesse to completely take over the lab so Gus can get rid of Walt.\n\n11. Eventually Gus is ready to kill Walt but Jesse insists that he won't continue to cook if Gus kills Walt. So instead Gus drags Walt out into the desert. fires him, threatens to murder his entire family and confirms that he intends to kill Walt's brother-in-law Hank. At this point Walt has no choice - for the sake of saving his brother-in-law's life and protecting his family against any future threat - but to go all in on his plan to kill Gus which he manages to do successfully.\n\n  \nNow let's look at who's to blame for the breakdown in Gus' operations.\n\nJesse is incredibly dumb and irrational in his response to the two dealers and created an irreparable rift with Gus **that Walt tried hard to de-escalate.** Walt wanted to 'shut up and cook', Jesse didn't.\n\nGus handled the situation poorly - largely because of his personal dislike of Jesse - and appeared to favour the two murderous dealers over Jesse who was much more irreplaceable in the operation. Jesse had a legitimate grievance with these two men that Gus didn't take seriously.\n\nDespite Walt's repeated attempts to resolve the whole thing without further violence, Jesse and Gus' actions created a series of escalating blows that forced Walt to eventually oppose Gus in order to save Jesse's life and later his own. Gus himself had multiple opportunities to put the thing to bed and let Walt 'shut up and cook', but once he decided to replace Walt with Gale he put Walt in a position where he had no choice but to blow up Gus' operation if he wanted to live.\n\nAnd yet Mike says the whole thing happened because of Walt's ego and the community have taken his word it. smdh.", "timestamp": 1763736377, "label": "1"}

{"original_topic": "breaking_bad", "comment": "Daily reminder that neither Mike nor Walt were \"right\" or \"wrong\", they were both pretty terrible people I saw a post yesterday about how Mike was wrong in his argument against Walt about how they had a good thing and Walt blew it up. I actually don't disagree with everything said about Mike's \"points\". I agree with a lot of it. \n\nI think Gus had Tomas murdered or at least knew that's what the dealers would do. Think about it. Gus' big thing is that his people don't operate without his consent or knowledge. Gus liked these dealers so much, he risked his relationship with Walt to protect them. There's no way they did that without Gus having at least mild knowledge of it. I think it was a play to get Jesse killed. Jesse goes to retaliate, believing Walt wouldn't care or react or even know about it until Jesse had already gone to the dealers. They were already waiting for him, Jesse gets gunned down and Gus consoles Walt after having the dealers killed by Mike for killing Tomas and causing the situation to begin with. Now Gus has Walt, his perfect lab and no more \"junkie\". Walt knew this, he figured it out and literally told Gus that hypothetically Jesse might have believed it was Gus' doing. The show writers wouldn't have Walt say this unless they wanted us to think about it. \n\nBut does that make Walt the good guy? Or Mike? No. Mike wanted to kill Jesse for a long time. He wanted to kill Jesse just for doing drugs after his girlfriend died. Literally told Walt, \"Let me take care of it\" intending to kill Jesse at a drug house when he was consumed with grief. The same Mike that we're supposed to believe saw Jesse as a son. \n\nOn the flip side, Mike figured Walt out and knew exactly what kind of man Walt was. Walt isn't a saint. He kept Jesse alive for his own selfish reasons. He used Jesse, manipulated him, took advantage of him. And let's not forget... Walt caused Jane to turn over and choke and then stood there while she choked. Walt is also the reason they got mixed up with Gus to begin with. \n\nHere's the list of garbage moves Walt made that caused Jesse's life to get progressively worse at every turn: \n\n1. When they were making cash hand over fist, Walt freaked out about Skinny Pete getting mugged which is absolutely a thing that dealers have to deal with. This put Jesse in a compromising situation for a wad of cash that they could easily make back on the back end. No retaliation is bad for business? You can retaliate in other ways. Black list those \"customers\" and they'll find a way to pay you back. Like Jesse said, they had the best product and no one else was dealing because Tuco was dead. \n\n2. After Jesse gets caught up in a situation that leads to a man's death, he starts getting cocky and pushes for them to expand. He tries to act like a know it all, pulling out a map and *teaching* Jesse, the one who is in charge of business, new areas to expand to. Jesse literally warns him that going into new territory will lead to violent encounters but Walt is happy to milk the MISBELIEF that Jesse killed Spooge even though he knows Jesse and his crew are no killers. At this point, they don't even have junior dealers working for Badger, Skinny Pete or Combo. \n\n3. Every single thing that Jesse warned Walt about happens. First, Badger gets arrested which costs them $80k to resolve. This also loses them a dealer. And then, disaster: Combo gets killed. Where? In new territory where Gus' dealers are. This means they're down two dealers and only have Skinny Pete. And he naturally wants out because Combo is dead. This also puts Jesse under tremendous stress which leads to him leaning heavily into drugs. Walt starts worrying about how they're going to sell 50 pounds of product, but he doesn't seem AT ALL worried about Jesse. He finagles a deal with a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy and manages to get a deal to sell all of his product to Gus. At this point, there's no doubt that Gus is most likely buying it just to get it off the market. \n\nThe entire reason they end up in business with Gus, the entire reason Combo was killed by Gus' dealers, the entire reason this whole business deal with Gus even starts is due to **WALT'S EGO**. His ego is also what led to them having their run-in with Tuco. Walt was angry about $1500-$2000 a day being too slow for him and wanted to sell to a distributor. Walt was angry about needing pseudo for a traditional cook so he concocted the plan to steal methylamine. Out of everyone, Gus and Walt are the only ones who didn't want to \"get out\" of the business. \n\nMike was a lot of things, and up until he finally warmed up to Jesse, he was a piece of shit in a lot of ways, but he wasn't in the business to be in the business. He was happy to get out ahead at various points in the series. Him and Jesse were willing to walk away, sell their shares of the methylamine and walk away with more money than they could've earned in a lifetime. But who wanted to stay? Walt. \n\nIt's easy to see Walt as the reasonable one who wanted to help Jesse.

I\u2019ve been rewatching Breaking Bad and noticed how often characters openly discuss criminal details over the phone: deals, locations, threats, everything.\n\nGiven the scale of the investigation (DEA, Hank, cartel attention, etc.), wouldn\u2019t phone tapping or surveillance have been a standard procedure at some point? Even Hank or Gomez mentioned something about tapped phones. It feels like this should\u2019ve led to several characters getting caught much earlier.\n\nAm I missing something in the show\u2019s logic, or is this actually a plot hole?\n\nEven more, how the raid of Los Pollos Hermanos trucks didn\u2019t get attention from DEA? I mean there were several raids where truck drivers were killed but that didn\u2019t ring bell for DEA.", "timestamp": 1763736378, "label": "0"}
{"original_topic": "breaking_bad", "comment": "Majority of the show happened in 1 year - and that's actually pretty realistic As most fans have figured that the majority of Breaking Bad happened in 2 years - with one year covering the first 4 seasons and first 3 episodes of season 5 and the remaining year was 13 episodes - some have said that this timeline is ridiculously unrealistic, but IMO it makes total sense, especially during binge watches. \n\nFrom my real life experiences, a lot can happen in one year, and sometimes 3-4 years and nothing changes besides that your best friend broke up with his girlfriend or your local Los Pollos joint gets shut down. It's all relative and based on perspectives. The same way people didn't know that the Beatles' discography only lasted about 7 years, because each album/image of the band was so different from one another.\n\n Breaking Bad happens to have a lot of events and multiple perspectives told through a lot of characters (who evolve a lot throughout the course of the series) with depths to them. That gives us the illusion that the show would be like 3-4 years in total.", "timestamp": 1763736378, "label": "1"}

{"original_topic": "breaking_bad", "comment": "Walter White: A Narcissist, But Not Entirely Looking for information, I\u2019ve seen tons of articles referring to Walter\u2019s narcissism, yet I haven\u2019t seen anyone mention a detail that could be relevant. Walter is not a narcissist from the start. Early in the series, he is shown as an empathetic man who loves his son. Some psychiatrists argue that at this point he is already a narcissist because he feels life owes him something\u2014a better job, making ends meet comfortably. I don\u2019t find this accurate, because this feeling is very human and it\u2019s exactly what makes us connect with him in the first place.\n\nPrimary narcissism arises as a response to childhood trauma and develops during adolescence. It is reinforced by individual traits, and empathy is either lost or severely damaged. Walter, rather, is in a state of emotional paralysis; his son\u2019s words hurt or scare him, and the circumstances of his life crush him.\n\nWalter\u2019s narcissism is secondary and, unlike primary narcissism, it is temporary. When Walter decides to \u201cchange,\u201d all the ego he had been suppressing for decades and his crippling sense of shame explode. Walter has no emotional tools to channel what is happening to him or to make a smooth transition of the self. All his resentment is released in every direction, and these narcissistic traits intensify more and more.\n\nArt imitates life. Many men (and some women), when living emotionally repressed lives and repeating traumatic patterns, become alcoholics, unfaithful, addicted to gambling\u2026 during a midlife crisis. Sometimes the trigger is illness, sometimes winning the lottery, or a meteoric career rise.", "timestamp": 1763736378, "label": "1"}

Zero second of fillers and the storyline is just so packed and well paced. \n\nThe show had this perfect balance of mystery, horror, thrill and heart back then. Season 1 feels like lightning in a bottle. Small town, small cast and one central mission, find Will. The world hadn't exploded into ten different storylines yet, the tension stayed insane. \n\nThe scale being small did wonders. One missing kid. One group of boys. One grieving mom. One girl with powers. One shady lab. That\u2019s it. And somehow it felt massive because the stakes were so personal.\n\nNo matter how big the show gets, that first season is always going to feel like lightning in a bottle. It set the tone perfectly. And this is why Season 2 is my 2nd favourite Season, it had the essence of Season 1. \n\nSeason 2 is the closest the show ever got to recapturing that formula. It felt like Hawkins wasn\u2019t drowning in plot threads unlike the later seasons. The characters were dealing with the fallout of Season 1, everyone was still connected, the tone stayed grounded, and Will\u2019s possession arc was just so damn strong.", "timestamp": 1763736379, "label": "1"}

Dustin, steve, and joy were my favorites.  Some negatives for me were how they gave no storyline for Jonathan in later seasons, he was my favorite and was glad he ended up with Nancy but  at the end of season 4 I kind of wanted Nancy to break up and get back with Steve. Eddie was one of the best characters added at the end while I coudnt really say the same about argyles character, I can totally see why they didn't invite him back as his characters tone and vibe wouldn't clash well for the final season.

{"original_topic": "stranger_things", "comment": "Anyone else really dislike Hopper? He\u2019s so toxic. \n\nEleven went through unimaginable trauma. She was treated like a lab rat for her entire life growing up, didn\u2019t have family, just experiments they did on her. She couldn\u2019t even interact regularly with others when she first escaped. She was then hunted by the lab as she experienced the first time what it\u2019s like being a human around others who aren\u2019t abusing her.\n\nEnter Hopper, her next abuser.\n\nHe essentially lures her and traps her in his house for over a year, not letting her leave, by scaring her so much. She went from a physical prison in the lab to a mental prison with Hopper. The only people she ever had any relationship with, just a few miles away, yet she can\u2019t see them or interact with them. Until she herself finally got the courage to rebel and break free from the mental prison he put her in. And he did this cause it made him feel good about losing his own daughter. He used her like a prop for his own soothing, all while talking to her and treating her like trash.\n\nAfter she finds out her mom is brain dead stuck in a recurring nightmare, and has no family left, Eleven finally reunited with Mike and the gang only because they found out she was alive. If it was for hopper to decide he would\u2019ve kept her mentally locked up in that house forever. She only now gets to leave because Hopper\u2019s cover is blown and he can\u2019t entrap her any more. \n\nThen when she starts forming the first real relationships in her life, and has Mike as her BF, Hopper is so toxic that he can\u2019t just let her be. Even Joyce tries to explain to him it\u2019s ok for her and Mike to be with each other like that. But Hopper can\u2019t stand to have her out of his control so much so that he gloats in literally threatening and bullying a child to stay away from Eleven and to further isolate her from others. There was no reason to do that. Literally none. He just couldn\u2019t stand that the relationship existed so for his own pleasure he destroyed it to further isolate her.\n\nHis abuse isn\u2019t as apparent as it should be. I\u2019m sure many people watching this show are saying \u201che\u2019s an overall good guy though.\u201d That\u2019s only cause he\u2019s taken on a cop savior role as his profession. To be clear, he\u2019s so useless as a cop that he himself doesn\u2019t figure things out. It\u2019s usually the kids or someone else figuring it out and he just provides man power to help assist. So he\u2019s not even that good at his job really. But his role and the little support he does give to main characters gives him an appearance of legitimacy and like he\u2019s a good guy and not an actual abuser to Eleven. \n\nHe also uses circumstances to hide his abuse. Like Eleven being hunted or needing to keep her identity hidden. That might be true but it doesn\u2019t require isolating her from others so much and treating her like trash while she\u2019s there. He goes way overboard on that because it helps him with his own trauma. \n\nThe saddest part is that Eleven has been abused so long in her life that, like Stockholm syndrome, she sees him as a good guy. The same way she saw Papa as good and built a bond with him when he abused her at the lab. \n\nWhen I thought Hopper died at the end of season 3, I thought wow he finally got a just end. Finally he\u2019s out of the show. Only for him to come back season 4 and find a way to waste screen time by being in a Russian prison and a side quest for Joyce that could\u2019ve been cut from the show without much impact. \n\nThis is one of the worst characters in the show. Even the way he smokes cigarettes and looks like his face is dirty all the time with unkept hair like he hasn\u2019t showered in a week and is out of shape cause he doesn\u2019t take care of himself. He has little to no redeeming qualities. \n\nI\u2019m not saying the guy is doing the abusing on purpose. I\u2019m saying he\u2019s so toxic that he\u2019s an abuser and he himself doesn\u2019t even realize it. Eleven doesn\u2019t either from Stockholm syndrome. And others aren\u2019t close enough to him and his relationship to Eleven to even know.", "timestamp": 1763736379, "label": "0"}
{"original_topic": "stranger_things", "comment": "my death predictions for the last season! Hey! I\u2019ve been thinking about the last season a lot as it approaches, and after watching some prediction videos about who might die in this last act of the show I decided to share my own thoughts! Even though I\u2019m the kind of person who loves when shows aren\u2019t afraid to kill off characters, Stranger Things has been proving time and time again that it\u2019s not that kind of story. So even if I long for a bigger kill count to raise the stakes, I genuinely don\u2019t think many characters are at risk of dying. Having said so, let me break my thoughts down for you! \n\nFirstly, I think Erica is completely safe! It\u2019s a bold affirmation to make, saying someone has zero percent chances of dying, but I can\u2019t see a reason for why they would kill her off. She doesn\u2019t seem to be involved in Lucas or Dustin\u2019s plot lines this season, and since they\u2019re the only two characters who have an emotional connection to her, her death wouldn\u2019t really be emotionally satisfying with anyone else around\u2026 she might join Lucas\u2019 storyline at some point, but I really can\u2019t see them killing her off because Lucas\u2019 main focus this season will be protecting Max. Killing his sister, while an interesting possibility for his arc, would probably make him too distraught to focus on anything else. Besides that, I also just genuinely don\u2019t think there\u2019s a way to make her death be satisfying. While killing a younger kid like her would show how horrifying the whole situation is, Erica is just far too removed from the other characters and the plot itself. Killing her off would make an impact too big for a character with so little relevance like her, if that makes sense? I just don\u2019t think the writers are willing to give her that much importance, she\u2019s not that central to the narrative and the story wouldn\u2019t benefit from it.\n\nFor the original party, the only one I can imagine them killing off is Will but I also don\u2019t think the writers will go there. I have conflicting thoughts about Will: while I would love for him to die in a \u201cit started with him, it has to end with him too\u201d way, I also think that it\u2019s an ending too dark for what the writers want their story to be. One could argue that killing Will would make the story feel unsatisfying because \u201cwhy would they go through so much to save him only for him to die in the end\u201d, and while I don\u2019t completely agree (mainly because I love tragic stories), I kinda can\u2019t argue against it. Will dying would completely break Joyce, and I just can\u2019t see a way for her to bounce back from that. I can\u2019t imagine a happy ending \u2014 which is what the writers seem to want to write \u2014 for her if Will dies, so I\u2019m pretty sure he survives. The other three boys are even less likely to die: Lucas is probably the most likely to be killed off out of the three, but I just can\u2019t picture him dying before Max wakes up and I can\u2019t imagine her having a happy ending with him dead (so unless Max also dies, Lucas is kinda safe on my book); Dustin sacrificing himself for the others wouldn\u2019t be a bad ending per se, but it would kinda make Eddie\u2019s sacrifice feel pointless, and I just don\u2019t think it would be a good move to kill character who used to be so cheery and heart-warming in the season where they\u2019re having an arc about dealing badly with someone\u2019s death (and also there are just too many people willing to sacrifice themselves for him); finally, Mike would be a super interesting choice for a death, but I can\u2019t imagine them killing him off. Mike needs to be there for the emotional impact of Eleven and Will\u2019s character arcs, whatever their endings may be, so he\u2019s also safe in my book. Also, I just can\u2019t imagine a happy ending for the Wheelers if he dies.\n\nSimilarly, I just can\u2019t picture a happy ending for them if Holly dies. She\u2019s having a more important role in the season, and judging from the leaks it would be kinda pointless to have her going on a side quest with Henry Creel/Vecna if she ends up dying in the end. The Wheelers (Mike and Nancy particularly, maybe Karen too if she isn\u2019t incapacitated the whole season) will go out of their way to save Holly after her disappearance, I doubt the writers would write that plot line only for it to end in the most unsatisfying end of all: Holly dying. I won\u2019t completely rule it out because it could be pulled off, but I seriously doubt they want to go with that route. \n\nSimilarly to Mike, I can\u2019t fathom a reality where Joyce isn\u2019t present in the final showdown to raise the emotional stakes for Eleven and Will. Her death would be bittersweet since her goal from day one was to protect her son from danger, and it wouldn\u2019t be completely unsatisfying if written correctly, but I just can\u2019t imagine it. I don\u2019t know if her children or Hopper would be able to bounce back from her death, and I feel like I don\u2019t even need to imagine it because she has very low chances of dying. I just can\u2019t see it, genuinely. Hopper is in a very similar place but slightly more likely to die because he doesn\u2019t have as many close connections (in that level) as Joyce, but they already did a fake-out with him so\u2026 I just feel like it would be cheap to repeat it. Eleven losing him twice would be devastating, and Joyce too after already having lost Bob. It\u2019s just really unlikely, I don\u2019t think he dies. \n\nAbout Max, I don\u2019t see a reason for them to keep her alive if they were going to kill her off in the next season. Again, killing a character after a fake-out feels cheap, especially when said character\u2019s death wouldn\u2019t align with the show\u2019s intended happy finale. Having Max go through so much just for her to die would be devastating, it would feel pointless and would give an awful message that no matter how hard you (a character who has been kicked down by life time and time again) fight, you can\u2019t escape the misery you lived in\u2026 I could accept her death in season four despite this, but the fake-out just makes it feel even more cruel. Why give her another chance only to rip it away again?\n\nThis is how I feel about Eleven as well. Her death would also give that impression, but my main problem isn\u2019t even that: I could see her dying if it didn\u2019t hurt Hopper\u2019s arc directly. Make him lose his daughter twice? He wouldn\u2019t bounce back. At most, I can see her sacrificing herself in a different way (maybe staying in the Upside Down, even if it\u2019s still unsatisfying) or just leaving Hawkins at the end of the story, but I don\u2019t know\u2026 she could go either way but I\u2019m leaning towards her survival as well. I won\u2019t be super shocked if she dies but I still believe she will survive in some way, however that way may be. \n\nMoving on to the teens, I think that Nancy and Jonathan will have the happy ending they deserve which means they will end up together living happily ever after. The one I can imagine dying the most is Jonathan because his arc has always been about taking care of others, but I just don\u2019t think Nancy or the Byers could achieve a truly happy ending if he were to die, and the same with Jonathan and the Wheelers for Nancy. They are too central for each other\u2026 I could see them dying but I just genuinely don\u2019t think the writers will do that, even if they did do a major disservice to Jonathan\u2019s character arc in the previous two seasons (not necessarily about him doing drugs, but just generally making him irrelevant). \n\nAbout Robin, I am kinda fearful for her future but as time goes on I\u2019m more certain of her survival\u2026 it just seems weird to kill her off after making her love interest (Vicky) more relevant. I do think there may be a somewhat good way to pull her death off, but I kinda just don\u2019t see them doing it? I won\u2019t completely rule it out, but the \u201cbury your gays\u201d trope just doesn\u2019t seem like something the writers might want to touch upon\u2026 but I don\u2019t know! Maybe her and Vicky having a relationship is a way for Robin\u2019s character to feel more fulfilled before killing her off? Maybe they\u2019ll kill Vicky before her? Even though I was initially concerned about her, I will stick to her survival. I do think it could go either way! \n\nOut of the main cast (I don\u2019t think of Murray or Vecna as main cast), Steve is definitely the most likely to die. Yes, he\u2019s been predicted to sacrifice himself for a long time now, but I do think there are some chances of it happening in this final season. Firstly, he\u2019s being set up as an obstacle between Nancy and Jonathan, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a satisfying way to make Stancy canon. Unless the writers screw up these three characters\u2019 arcs (more than they did with the fourth season), Steve will not be getting the girl. Not getting the girl doesn\u2019t mean said girl won\u2019t care about his death though, and Steve is definitely a character whose death would affect other characters without ruining their happiness too much. I can picture a happy ending for Robin even if Steve dies (of course she would mourn her best friend\u2019s death and be affected by it), and even Dustin may come out of it psychologically healthy enough to have a believable happy ending. Steve\u2019s arc would wrap up nicely with him realizing that his search for romantic love wasn\u2019t that big of a need for him because the love that truly matters (platonic love from his best friends) was already enough. Him dying to protect said friends would be a satisfying end, even if it would be a really sad one for the fans. But I also don\u2019t make this guess with a lot of certainty, I don\u2019t feel confident enough about it to really scream \u201cSTEVE WILL DIE\u201d. It could go either way, but I do think that if someone from the main cast is killed it\u2019s gonna be him (or Robin).\n\nI don\u2019t see a way for Vecna to survive the show (unless he\u2019s forever stuck in the upside down or something) so I won\u2019t really talk about him. Instead, I\u2019ll touch upon the Wheeler parents. Karen will definitely be attacked by a Demogorgon in episode 2 but I do think she will be taken to the hospital \u2014 and why would she be taken there if she wasn\u2019t going to survive? To prolong Nancy\u2019s pain a little bit? I did think she would die initially, but after seeing the scene of Nancy washing her hands in the hospital, I just think it would be pointless to go through so much trouble to take her to the hospital only to kill her off right after. On the other hand, Ted might not live to tell the story. While having this attack be what wakes him up finally and make him start really taking care of his family (and value his wife) would be a good direction to take his character, I kinda think it\u2019s not the direction they\u2019ll take him\u2026 someone has to die for the stakes to feel existent, so Ted is the safest choice to kill without upsetting the characters or the fans too much. Sure, the Wheelers will be devastated in a way, but Ted\u2019s death is more beneficial to their arcs than his survival. Karen won\u2019t be stuck with her deadbeat husband and the kids aren\u2019t shown to be close enough to Ted to be depressed for a long time. It would be a nice redemption arc if he survived, but I don\u2019t know if he will\u2026 \n\nMurray is somewhat prone to dying as well: his death would definitely raise the stakes but it would be that upsetting either. Hopper and Joyce might grieve him for a bit, but in the end he really wasn\u2019t that close to the other characters. Him not being present in the epilogue wouldn\u2019t make it seem like a sad ending, so he\u2019s a safe kill choice to make. He\u2019s my biggest death bet overall (except probably Vecna). \n\nIn the end, I really can\u2019t imagine the writers killing many characters off. There may be some secondary characters dying, but I think that only one or two main characters will die, three at most \u2014 and my bets for that possibility would be Steve, Robin and Eleven. But still I don\u2019t think it\u2019s very likely. It\u2019s kinda unfortunate for viewers like me who really like high stakes and deaths, but Stranger Things has always been a story about the good winning in the end. A part of me does hope I\u2019m wrong, but I don\u2019t have high hopes for it. And I don\u2019t mean it in a bad way, I think I\u2019ll like the ending despite how many people die! I trust the writers will do a good job with the characters, no matter if their arcs conclude in death or not.

{"original_topic": "stranger_things", "comment": "My death prediction for season five As season five is coming up, I have made a list of people who will die in season five. This my prediction and here's my explanation. \n\n\n\nHere are the list: \n\n1) Lt Colonel Jack Sullivan. He's most definitely going to die in season five. My explanation is that he and his soldiers are going to be attacked by Vecna and the Demogorgons. We saw the trailer and promo of Demogorgons attacking and fighting the U.S. soldiers. He believes that Eleven is the source, but he's stubborn and mouth breather. Vecna might deal with him and see that he is 100 percent wrong about Eleven. \n\n2) Andy. If you don't know, Andy is one of Jason's friends and teammate of the basketball team. We see an image promo of him and his buddy Chance bullying Dustin because he's in Hellfire Club and blames Eddie for the rift. He still belives in Jason's cause and beliefs. I hope he and his basketball team are next when the Demogorgons are unleashed in Hawkins. We saw promos and trailers of Demogorgons attacking in the hospital, road, the town center, and Mike's house. Andy is a mouth breather and he'll be wrong when he see that Eddie was innocent and Jason was a psycho once the Demogorgon or Vecna confronts him.\n\n3) Chance. Chance is another friend of Jason and member of the basketball team. He looks like a villain when I saw the promo image of him smiling sinisterly when Andy bullied Dustin. He's a mouth breather and he'll might likely to be attacked by the Demogorgons once they attacked the town under Vecna's orders. Hope he'll see Jason, again. Well, half of him. \n\n4) The guy from the town meeting in 4x6. He's the guy that has a beard, glasses and a hat. He looks overweight. He was the first one to join Jason's cause during his Mouth breathing speech. He and Jason are the cause of the rifts to be open and let Vecna win. He was walking with his dog and spotted the party in Creel house, and informed Jason about it. I think he'll be the first one to die when the Demogorgons or Vecna starts their invasion. If he does, then he deserve it. \n\n5) Dr Kay. I think she'll might be defeated by Vecna or Demogorgons in season five but we don't know if it does or not. She's the new character and played by Linda Hamilton. She's aftering Eleven and wants her alive. I think she's working for Lt Colonel Jack Sullivan. \n\n6) Robert Akers. From what I learned from the cast list, he's working with Dr Kay to help capture Eleven alive. I think he'll be next from the Demogorgons attacked or Vecna.\n\n7) Vecna/One/Henry Creel. He will be defeated by The Party but we're not sure who will defeat him. Either Eleven or Will but we'll find out once season five is fully release on Netflix. \n\nHonorable mentions of those who will most likely to die: \n\n1) Powell and Callahan. These guys will most likely sacrificed themselves to save Hopper and Eleven. I think but we'll see. \n\n2) Ted Wheeler. He'll sacrificed himself to save his family from Demogorgons and Vecna. We even seen Nancy crying when she was washing her hands with blood in the teasers, trailers, and promo. I think it might be Ted Wheeler since everyone is talking about it. \n\n3)  Victor Creel. If Vecna/One/Henry Creel shows up at the asylum where his dad is located, he'll might visit him one last time before finishing him off. I think. \n\n4) Dr Owens. He'll might sacrificed himself to save Eleven and give her advice and tips to defeat Vecna.\n\n5) The basketball team and other people who believe in Jason's belief. I hope the Demogorgons and Vecna deal with him because they'll see that Jason is wrong and a mouth breather. \n\n6) Angela and her friends. If they show up in Hawkins and tries to come after Eleven. Vecna will deal with them and say there can only be one and that's Vecna. \n\n\nIf you wonder where's the rest of the main characters and why they are not part of the list, here's why. The reason is that I hope they all survive and defeat Vecna because they all deserve a happy ending. I mean, they went through so much in the past four seasons, and they deserve better. Mike, Eleven, Lucas, Dustin, Will, Nancy, Johnathan, Joyce, Hopper, Murray, Erica, Steve, Robin, Max, Vickie, Holly, Karen, and anyone from the party deserve better. \n\nI know everyone is worry about their fates since this is the final season, but we'll see what happens next once the final season comes out. I'm not ready as well because this is the last time we'll see our favorite characters for their one last epic adventure. The Party will defeat Vecna and avenge those they lost in the past such as Barbara, Bob, Alexi, Billy, Chrissy, Fred, and Eddie. We'll never forget them. Get ready because season five is coming in 6 days.", "timestamp": 1763736379, "label": "1"}

{"original_topic": "stranger_things", "comment": "Mike appreciation. Here's a list of things he has done: Season 1\n\n- D&amp;D Dungeon Master - something nobody likes to be\n- Provided his basement as the main hangout spot \n- Took in a young girl in trouble purely out of kindness \n- Let Eleven hide in his basement for months \n- Brought Eleven back home even after everyone thought she had lied about Will being alive just for shelter \n- Believed Eleven and inevitably discovered proof of Will being alive \n- Hatched a plan to save Will \n- Tried to keep Eleven safe from the Hawkins baddies \n\nSeason 2\n\n- Called Eleven everyday for 353 days when everyone thought she had died \n- Paid attention to Will and got him out of his trance everytime he had an \"episode\" (e.g. outside the arcade, or halloween) \n- Stuck with Will when he got worse because of the Mind Flayer possessing him \n- Figured out that Will could spy on the MF, which was the only reason they were able to find and save Hopper from the tunnels \n- Figured out Will was spying back (but it was too late) \n- Encouraged his friends to come up with a plan to help Eleven and Hopper when they went to close the gate in season 2. This leads them back to the tunnels where they burn the shit out of the hub WHICH also helps Joyce and Co. when they're exorcising Will. \n\nSeason 3\n\n- Finally starts dating Eleven and spends most of his summer in her cabin since she can't leave and be seen by too many people \n- Immediately mobilises the troops (all the friends) when he realises the mindflayer is back \n- Plans the Sauna Test to check if Billy is flayed \n- Slams the shit outta Billy when he's choking Eleven\n- IS THE ONLY ONE WHO IS CONCERNED ABOUT \nELEVEN'S HEALTH AND SAFETY WHEN SHE'S USING HER POWERS TO HELP AND SAVE EVERYONE \n- Uses physics to turn the car upside down when Eleven's powers don't work\n- Emotional support for Eleven when she loses her powers \n\nSeason 4 \n\n- Visits Eleven and Will in California over Spring Break \n- Leaves with Will and Jonathan to find Eleven when they realise the Hawkins baddies have her again\n- Figures out that the pen from unknown hero agent man was the clue to finding Eleven\n- Hatches a plan to find Suzie so that she can find Eleven's location\n- Saves Eleven with the help of Jonathan, Will, and Argyle\n- Expresses his unconditional love for Eleven when she needs it the most, helping her defeat Vecna (at least temporarily)\n\n\nI am tired of all the Mike hate. It is fckn ridiculous. \n\nMike has been the kindest and nicest little boy since the beginning. There's a reason Will called him \"the heart.\" Without Mike being the way he is they never would've found Eleven, and by extention, Will. The other kids are all smart as well but nobody is as kind as Mike. I'm probably even missing some other good stuff he's done because I'm writing this based off of what I remember. \n\n- Being mean to Max in s2 is just a teenager lashing out. He hates that Eleven isn't around and is annoyed that Max is. \n\n- Being distant from his friends during summer vacation in S3 was completely justified. That kid called Eleven everyday for 353 days in s2 and then in s3 she's finally here, not dying or under threat. What did you expect? lol. \nIt was also just during summer vacation that they were spending all day together. Mike was not some obsessed creep who was skipping school to make out with Eleven.\n\nI'm tired of people complaining about Mike being a dick to Will in s4. He is a child. He doesn't even know Will is gay, since Will has never told anyone. His own mother does not know this about him. Jonathan only realises this because of their road trip, and the fact that he's older than Mike and knows Will much better since he's his BROTHER. Mike has proven his loyalty to Will, time and again, and people still hate on the kid for god knows what. \n\nMike has been absolutely consistent in his character from the beginning. He does stupid things sometimes like \"it's not my fault you don't like girls\" but that's just a teenager being a teenager. \n\nSTOP HATING ON A LITERAL CHILD. \n\nDownvote me. I don't care.

MODs please if you think you need to do the spoiler cover. Please do. I don't know how to do it. Welp.\n\nIf you don't want to be spoiled about the stranger things play. Don't read ANY further!!\n\nFirst of all,  I was going to say. Wow that's long. Almost 3 hours. Why do ALL the characters behave like they're being chased by demogorgons or Vecna himself by the way they speak so freaking fast?! Like damn, enunciate! They honestly all talk in a frenzy it's weird. It's honestly chaotic to watch.\n\nAnyway, these are my interesting observations:\n\n* I read here years ago that someone is speculating that 000 is Dr. Brenner. Well, they're half right! LOL. Dr. Brenner's father IS 000! He was the first surviving victim of the MF.\n* They're kind of hinting that Joyce is a lesbian? Well there's a scene where they're outright saying SHE's a lesbian! Is there going to be a Robin phase revelation of Joyce in S5? Also from what I saw I think she is a lesbian!  Joyce does not seem to be interested in either Hopper or Bob. Now about Lonnie, not sure if they really were dating because I don't remember seeing them as a couple in the play?\n* Karen is the MF!!! Well at least that's what I gathered from that one scene of hers. Where her clothes were off and she is wearing a spider bra! And she also has a pentagon cauldron? Ya Karen IS the big bad not Vecna!\n* There's a confusing scene with Hopper where he is acting like Norman Bates level PSYCHO. I am not sure if that was part of the play in the show or what REALLY is happening in Hawkins. Ya the show is confusing, it's UNREAL! Did Hopper kill his parents?? Hopper is also abused by his father like BILLY!\n* Vecna's parents LOVE him. His mom loves him. I think the MF made him think he is unloved. There's also a scene where Dr. Brenner gave her pills to take. That was the day Henry was returned to his care the 2nd time. So it seems to me. Dr. Brenner drugged Henry's mom to make her do what he wants?\n\n  \nThat's what I remember were PRETTY interesting scenes.

Season 1 feels like lightning in a bottle. Small town, small cast and one central mission, find Will.

First gotta say that Winona ryder was the best part for me getting into it as her acting was phenomenal, I do believe season 1 and 3 were the  best seasons for me while 2 was the lowest of them all. Dustin, steve, and joy were my favorites.  Some negatives for me were how they gave no storyline for Jonathan in later seasons, he was my favorite and was glad he ended up with Nancy but  at the end of season 4 I kind of wanted Nancy to break up and get back with Steve. Eddie was one of the best characters added at the end while I coudnt really say the same about argyles character, I can totally see why they didn't invite him back as his characters tone and vibe wouldn't clash well for the final season. My last negative was wtf was the storyline with 11's sister, I can't be the only one who skipped it cause it was uninteresting", "timestamp": 1763736380, "label": "1"}

{"original_topic": "stranger_things", "comment": "Anyone else really dislike Hopper? He\u2019s so toxic. \n\nEleven went through unimaginable trauma. She was treated like a lab rat for her entire life growing up, didn\u2019t have family, just experiments they did on her. She couldn\u2019t even interact regularly with others when she first escaped. She was then hunted by the lab as she experienced the first time what it\u2019s like being a human around others who aren\u2019t abusing her.\n\nEnter Hopper, her next abuser.\n\nHe essentially lures her and traps her in his house for over a year, not letting her leave, by scaring her so much. She went from a physical prison in the lab to a mental prison with Hopper. The only people she ever had any relationship with, just a few miles away, yet she can\u2019t see them or interact with them. Until she herself finally got the courage to rebel and break free from the mental prison he put her in. And he did this cause it made him feel good about losing his own daughter. He used her like a prop for his own soothing, all while talking to her and treating her like trash.\n\nAfter she finds out her mom is brain dead stuck in a recurring nightmare, and has no family left, Eleven finally reunited with Mike and the gang only because they found out she was alive. If it was for hopper to decide he would\u2019ve kept her mentally locked up in that house forever. She only now gets to leave because Hopper\u2019s cover is blown and he can\u2019t entrap her any more. \n\nThen when she starts forming the first real relationships in her life, and has Mike as her BF, Hopper is so toxic that he can\u2019t just let her be. Even Joyce tries to explain to him it\u2019s ok for her and Mike to be with each other like that. But Hopper can\u2019t stand to have her out of his control so much so that he gloats in literally threatening and bullying a child to stay away from Eleven and to further isolate her from others. There was no reason to do that. Literally none. He just couldn\u2019t stand that the relationship existed so for his own pleasure he destroyed it to further isolate her.\n\nHis abuse isn\u2019t as apparent as it should be. I\u2019m sure many people watching this show are saying \u201che\u2019s an overall good guy though.\u201d That\u2019s only cause he\u2019s taken on a cop savior role as his profession. To be clear, he\u2019s so useless as a cop that he himself doesn\u2019t figure things out. It\u2019s usually the kids or someone else figuring it out and he just provides man power to help assist. So he\u2019s not even that good at his job really. But his role and the little support he does give to main characters gives him an appearance of legitimacy and like he\u2019s a good guy and not an actual abuser to Eleven. \n\nHe also uses circumstances to hide his abuse. Like Eleven being hunted or needing to keep her identity hidden. That might be true but it doesn\u2019t require isolating her from others so much and treating her like trash while she\u2019s there. He goes way overboard on that because it helps him with his own trauma. \n\nThe saddest part is that Eleven has been abused so long in her life that, like Stockholm syndrome, she sees him as a good guy. The same way she saw Papa as good and built a bond with him when he abused her at the lab. \n\nWhen I thought Hopper died at the end of season 3, I thought wow he finally got a just end. Finally he\u2019s out of the show. Only for him to come back season 4 and find a way to waste screen time by being in a Russian prison and a side quest for Joyce that could\u2019ve been cut from the show without much impact. \n\nThis is one of the worst characters in the show. Even the way he smokes cigarettes and looks like his face is dirty all the time with unkept hair like he hasn\u2019t showered in a week and is out of shape cause he doesn\u2019t take care of himself. He has little to no redeeming qualities. \n\nI\u2019m not saying the guy is doing the abusing on purpose. I\u2019m saying he\u2019s so toxic that he\u2019s an abuser and he himself doesn\u2019t even realize it. Eleven doesn\u2019t either from Stockholm syndrome. And others aren\u2019t close enough to him and his relationship to Eleven to even know.", "timestamp": 1763736380, "label": "0"}
{"original_topic": "stranger_things", "comment": "my death predictions for the last season! Hey! I\u2019ve been thinking about the last season a lot as it approaches, and after watching some prediction videos about who might die in this last act of the show I decided to share my own thoughts! Even though I\u2019m the kind of person who loves when shows aren\u2019t afraid to kill off characters, Stranger Things has been proving time and time again that it\u2019s not that kind of story. So even if I long for a bigger kill count to raise the stakes, I genuinely don\u2019t think many characters are at risk of dying. Having said so, let me break my thoughts down for you! \n\nFirstly, I think Erica is completely safe! It\u2019s a bold affirmation to make, saying someone has zero percent chances of dying, but I can\u2019t see a reason for why they would kill her off. She doesn\u2019t seem to be involved in Lucas or Dustin\u2019s plot lines this season, and since they\u2019re the only two characters who have an emotional connection to her, her death wouldn\u2019t really be emotionally satisfying with anyone else around\u2026 she might join Lucas\u2019 storyline at some point, but I really can\u2019t see them killing her off because Lucas\u2019 main focus this season will be protecting Max. Killing his sister, while an interesting possibility for his arc, would probably make him too distraught to focus on anything else. Besides that, I also just genuinely don\u2019t think there\u2019s a way to make her death be satisfying. While killing a younger kid like her would show how horrifying the whole situation is, Erica is just far too removed from the other characters and the plot itself. Killing her off would make an impact too big for a character with so little relevance like her, if that makes sense? I just don\u2019t think the writers are willing to give her that much importance, she\u2019s not that central to the narrative and the story wouldn\u2019t benefit from it.\n\nFor the original party, the only one I can imagine them killing off is Will but I also don\u2019t think the writers will go there. I have conflicting thoughts about Will: while I would love for him to die in a \u201cit started with him, it has to end with him too\u201d way, I also think that it\u2019s an ending too dark for what the writers want their story to be. One could argue that killing Will would make the story feel unsatisfying because \u201cwhy would they go through so much to save him only for him to die in the end\u201d, and while I don\u2019t completely agree (mainly because I love tragic stories), I kinda can\u2019t argue against it. Will dying would completely break Joyce, and I just can\u2019t see a way for her to bounce back from that. I can\u2019t imagine a happy ending \u2014 which is what the writers seem to want to write \u2014 for her if Will dies, so I\u2019m pretty sure he survives. The other three boys are even less likely to die: Lucas is probably the most likely to be killed off out of the three, but I just can\u2019t picture him dying before Max wakes up and I can\u2019t imagine her having a happy ending with him dead (so unless Max also dies, Lucas is kinda safe on my book); Dustin sacrificing himself for the others wouldn\u2019t be a bad ending per se, but it would kinda make Eddie\u2019s sacrifice feel pointless, and I just don\u2019t think it would be a good move to kill character who used to be so cheery and heart-warming in the season where they\u2019re having an arc about dealing badly with someone\u2019s death (and also there are just too many people willing to sacrifice themselves for him); finally, Mike would be a super interesting choice for a death, but I can\u2019t imagine them killing him off. Mike needs to be there for the emotional impact of Eleven and Will\u2019s character arcs, whatever their endings may be, so he\u2019s also safe in my book. Also, I just can\u2019t imagine a happy ending for the Wheelers if he dies.\n\nSimilarly, I just can\u2019t picture a happy ending for them if Holly dies. She\u2019s having a more important role in the season, and judging from the leaks it would be kinda pointless to have her going on a side quest with Henry Creel/Vecna if she ends up dying in the end. The Wheelers (Mike and Nancy particularly, maybe Karen too if she isn\u2019t incapacitated the whole season) will go out of their way to save Holly after her disappearance, I doubt the writers would write that plot line only for it to end in the most unsatisfying end of all: Holly dying. I won\u2019t completely rule it out because it could be pulled off, but I seriously doubt they want to go with that route. \n\nSimilarly to Mike, I can\u2019t fathom a reality where Joyce isn\u2019t present in the final showdown to raise the emotional stakes for Eleven and Will. Her death would be bittersweet since her goal from day one was to protect her son from danger, and it wouldn\u2019t be completely unsatisfying if written correctly, but I just can\u2019t imagine it. I don\u2019t know if her children or Hopper would be able to bounce back from her death, and I feel like I don\u2019t even need to imagine it because she has very low chances of dying. I just can\u2019t see it, genuinely. Hopper is in a very similar place but slightly more likely to die because he doesn\u2019t have as many close connections (in that level) as Joyce, but they already did a fake-out with him so\u2026 I just feel like it would be cheap to repeat it. Eleven losing him twice would be devastating, and Joyce too after already having lost Bob. It\u2019s just really unlikely, I don\u2019t think he dies. \n\nAbout Max, I don\u2019t see a reason for them to keep her alive if they were going to kill her off in the next season. Again, killing a character after a fake-out feels cheap, especially when said character\u2019s death wouldn\u2019t align with the show\u2019s intended happy finale. Having Max go through so much just for her to die would be devastating, it would feel pointless and would give an awful message that no matter how hard you (a character who has been kicked down by life time and time again) fight, you can\u2019t escape the misery you lived in\u2026 I could accept her death in season four despite this, but the fake-out just makes it feel even more cruel. Why give her another chance only to rip it away again?\n\nThis is how I feel about Eleven as well. Her death would also give that impression, but my main problem isn\u2019t even that: I could see her dying if it didn\u2019t hurt Hopper\u2019s arc directly. Make him lose his daughter twice? He wouldn\u2019t bounce back. At most, I can see her sacrificing herself in a different way (maybe staying in the Upside Down, even if it\u2019s still unsatisfying) or just leaving Hawkins at the end of the story, but I don\u2019t know\u2026 she could go either way but I\u2019m leaning towards her survival as well. I won\u2019t be super shocked if she dies but I still believe she will survive in some way, however that way may be. \n\nMoving on to the teens, I think that Nancy and Jonathan will have the happy ending they deserve which means they will end up together living happily ever after. The one I can imagine dying the most is Jonathan because his arc has always been about taking care of others, but I just don\u2019t think Nancy or the Byers could achieve a truly happy ending if he were to die, and the same with Jonathan and the Wheelers for Nancy. They are too central for each other\u2026 I could see them dying but I just genuinely don\u2019t think the writers will do that, even if they did do a major disservice to Jonathan\u2019s character arc in the previous two seasons (not necessarily about him doing drugs, but just generally making him irrelevant). \n\nAbout Robin, I am kinda fearful for her future but as time goes on I\u2019m more certain of her survival\u2026 it just seems weird to kill her off after making her love interest (Vicky) more relevant. I do think there may be a somewhat good way to pull her death off, but I kinda just don\u2019t see them doing it? I won\u2019t completely rule it out, but the \u201cbury your gays\u201d trope just doesn\u2019t seem like something the writers might want to touch upon\u2026 but I don\u2019t know! Maybe her and Vicky having a relationship is a way for Robin\u2019s character to feel more fulfilled before killing her off? Maybe they\u2019ll kill Vicky before her? Even though I was initially concerned about her, I will stick to her survival. I do think it could go either way! \n\nOut of the main cast (I don\u2019t think of Murray or Vecna as main cast), Steve is definitely the most likely to die. Yes, he\u2019s been predicted to sacrifice himself for a long time now, but I do think there are some chances of it happening in this final season. Firstly, he\u2019s being set up as an obstacle between Nancy and Jonathan, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a satisfying way to make Stancy canon. Unless the writers screw up these three characters\u2019 arcs (more than they did with the fourth season), Steve will not be getting the girl. Not getting the girl doesn\u2019t mean said girl won\u2019t care about his death though, and Steve is definitely a character whose death would affect other characters without ruining their happiness too much. I can picture a happy ending for Robin even if Steve dies (of course she would mourn her best friend\u2019s death and be affected by it), and even Dustin may come out of it psychologically healthy enough to have a believable happy ending. Steve\u2019s arc would wrap up nicely with him realizing that his search for romantic love wasn\u2019t that big of a need for him because the love that truly matters (platonic love from his best friends) was already enough. Him dying to protect said friends would be a satisfying end, even if it would be a really sad one for the fans. But I also don\u2019t make this guess with a lot of certainty, I don\u2019t feel confident enough about it to really scream \u201cSTEVE WILL DIE\u201d. It could go either way, but I do think that if someone from the main cast is killed it\u2019s gonna be him (or Robin).\n\nI don\u2019t see a way for Vecna to survive the show (unless he\u2019s forever stuck in the upside down or something) so I won\u2019t really talk about him. Instead, I\u2019ll touch upon the Wheeler parents. Karen will definitely be attacked by a Demogorgon in episode 2 but I do think she will be taken to the hospital \u2014 and why would she be taken there if she wasn\u2019t going to survive? To prolong Nancy\u2019s pain a little bit? I did think she would die initially, but after seeing the scene of Nancy washing her hands in the hospital, I just think it would be pointless to go through so much trouble to take her to the hospital only to kill her off right after. On the other hand, Ted might not live to tell the story. While having this attack be what wakes him up finally and make him start really taking care of his family (and value his wife) would be a good direction to take his character, I kinda think it\u2019s not the direction they\u2019ll take him\u2026 someone has to die for the stakes to feel existent, so Ted is the safest choice to kill without upsetting the characters or the fans too much. Sure, the Wheelers will be devastated in a way, but Ted\u2019s death is more beneficial to their arcs than his survival. Karen won\u2019t be stuck with her deadbeat husband and the kids aren\u2019t shown to be close enough to Ted to be depressed for a long time. It would be a nice redemption arc if he survived, but I don\u2019t know if he will\u2026 \n\nMurray is somewhat prone to dying as well: his death would definitely raise the stakes but it would be that upsetting either. Hopper and Joyce might grieve him for a bit, but in the end he really wasn\u2019t that close to the other characters. Him not being present in the epilogue wouldn\u2019t make it seem like a sad ending, so he\u2019s a safe kill choice to make. He\u2019s my biggest death bet overall (except probably Vecna). \n\nIn the end, I really can\u2019t imagine the writers killing many characters off. There may be some secondary characters dying, but I think that only one or two main characters will die, three at most \u2014 and my bets for that possibility would be Steve, Robin and Eleven. But still I don\u2019t think it\u2019s very likely. It\u2019s kinda unfortunate for viewers like me who really like high stakes and deaths, but Stranger Things has always been a story about the good winning in the end. A part of me does hope I\u2019m wrong, but I don\u2019t have high hopes for it. And I don\u2019t mean it in a bad way, I think I\u2019ll like the ending despite how many people die! I trust the writers will do a good job with the characters, no matter if their arcs conclude in death or not. This concludes my thoughts, so thanks for reading!", "timestamp": 1763736380, "label": "1"}

This creates a moral dilemma for Michael: betray his mom to Tommy, or betray Tommy for his mom, eventually choosing to betray Tommy.

{"original_topic": "peaky_blinders", "comment": "I love watching interviews and listening to how they talk about the show and this story. Steven Knight:\n\nKnight also referenced  his  relationship in the Esquire interview, telling fans why Grace had to be killed off.\nHe said: \u201cIt was tempting to give him that sort of happiness with Grace.\n\u201cBut I just think if he ever finds happiness and contentment then the thing that makes him extraordinary will probably go away. \n\n\n\n\\-It shut him down emotionally?-\n \n\"During really horrific war situations, human beings change very quickly. Some part of the subconscious decides \u2018If you\u2019re going to survive, you\u2019ve got to be like this\u2019 so that\u2019s who you become \u2013 hard and brutal and all of those things that happen to soldiers. When Tommy got back, he couldn\u2019t stop that. He was frozen inside, like a lot of people who\u2019ve suffered the trauma of war.\nTommy was locked up and frozen inside for a long time. Then he met Grace and she changed things, she unlocked the doors a bit. Then as soon as that happens, it gets closed down again because she gets killed.\nWhat I keep doing with these characters is offering them a road to happiness and then blowing the bridge up and not letting them go down it. Polly too, would have been happy perhaps with Aberama, but then he\u2019s taken away from her as well.\"\n\n\n-Is there special significance to Grace\u2019s name?- \n\n\"Yes. She was exactly that, the old Puritan Christian concept of grace \u2013 whether you\u2019re good or not, sometimes somebody comes to you and saves you, even if you don\u2019t deserve it. The idea of an unearned saviour coming to save you is exactly what Grace was, and Tommy sort of didn\u2019t deserve it. Then she was taken away so he was thrown back.\"\n\n  \nCillian Murphy :\n\n\nTell us about Tommy\u2019s relationship with Grace\n\n\"He meets this girl who works in the pub and she gets to him. You begin to see the chink and the man that we would have known from before the war. It\u2019s a beautifully observed relationship because it happens very, very subtly and slowly - it\u2019s sort of a gradual defrosting between the two of them. It becomes quite intense over the course of the series. He has that fierce drive and ambition, and capacity for violence but also you see the other side of the man and the beauty of it is that he starts falling in love with this girl.\"\n\n  \n\" We meet him at the beginning of season 3\n you know he kind of ostensibly has\neverything that he could wish for you know certainly materially and you would expect emotionally because he now has you know the woman that he loves and he has a little baby and he has lived in this vast vast  mansion.\"\n\n\"Grace and the kid represent kind of the  purity in his life you know really and  then over the course of the season she gets stolen away from him and then  right the end the kid gets stolen away from him and so they kind of everything  that's pure in his life seems to be  under  trait throughout the course of this ser\u00edes.\"\n\n\n\" it's heartbroken,. she's such a fantastic character and  you know such a great time working with  Annabelle on the show and you know she  in one and two she kind of  altered to Tommy I think that light side of Tommy  that he left behind in the trenches and in France um was kind of reignited by her and I love the duality of the character because she is in  one hand a secret agente and then the other hand  you know\n a loving wife and she's a strong strong\n lady , Steven  write such strong women so yeah it's a bit of a  shocker to read it.\"\n\n  \n\" I think the pre-war Tommy used to smile a lot, he laughed a lot, he wanted to work with horses.\nHe was very romantic.\nAnd all of these things, you see scratches of them, you know,\nthroughout the show and there's times when he feels like he's getting towards some sort of healing when he's with Grace.\nAnd then it's taken away again.\nAnd then he retreats back into that kind of shell emotionally.\"\n\n  \nCillian Murphy agrees that Tommy Shelby was, and still is, beholden to the women in his life. \u201cAll the good stuff in Tommy comes, through his mother, from the Romany side. Polly\u2019s the one he trusts most. And he loves his sister, Ada, even though he\u2019s frustrated by her politics. His romantic relations are less straightforward.\u201d\n\nThat puts it mildly. In series one and two, Tommy swung between Irish secret agent Grace Burgess and horse-loving aristocrat May Carleton. No sooner did he marry Grace at the beginning of series three than she was murdered. Since then, he\u2019s had a go at orgies and erotic asphyxiation with Tatiana, a double-crossing White Russian, and enjoyed regular hook-ups with his brother John\u2019s ex-fianc\u00e9e, Lizzie Stark.\n\nMurphy takes a deep breath. \u201cRight,\u201d he says, \u201cduring the time Tommy was married to Grace he was completely faithful. Prior to that, sex was basically a way of self-medicating, then Grace\u2019s death spun him off into something else entirely. I think that as we meet him now, he\u2019s probably shut down again emotionally, and sex is just a physical need that has to be met.\u201d\n\n  \nThey are all different interviews.", "timestamp": 1763736380, "label": "1"}

He went from being a selfish, jealous bully to the best goddamn babysitter on the planet! Ever since he saw the Demogorgon at the Byers house in S1, he has become such a good guy. He is fiercely protective about those he cares about, especially the younger kids, who he often has to help protect as they go through with their VERY dangerous plans to combat the Upside Down.\n\nIn S4, he tells Nancy he's been thinking about what he wants his life to look like after this is all over. He's always dreamed of having a wife and 6 kids, packing them into an RV, and driving around the country to see the Grand Canyon and other great wonders of the world. He later admits to Nancy in the Upside Down that she is the wife he's been dreaming of. He has never fully gotten over her.\n\nWhile Nancy does care about Steve a lot, she has a boyfriend despite their issues and she only sees Steve as a close friend. You can tell by the look on her face she was hoping he wouldn't say that. And not only that, but Steve's dream sounds like a nightmare for someone as driven as Nancy. To have 6 kids at that point in time, Nancy would have to be a stay at home mom. And she seems like someone who would want her own career to feel fulfilled, like becoming a journalist.\n\nSomething many fans don't realize is that Steve's dream has already come true, just not in the way he had thought. He did in fact drive around in an RV with Nancy and 6 kids to prepare to go after Vecna. That sounds like an incredible setup for an absolutely devastating death.\n\nDo you think Steve will die? Will he sacrifice himself to save one of the kids or even Nancy herself? Is Steve dying the reason why Nancy is crying and washing blood off her hands in the S5 trailer? I know most fans would be heartbroken over this and I do not want it to happen, but it seems probable that it could happen.", "timestamp": 1763737787, "label": "ERROR"}

Zero second of fillers and the storyline is just so packed and well paced. \n\nThe show had this perfect balance of mystery, horror, thrill and heart back then. Season 1 feels like lightning in a bottle. Small town, small cast and one central mission, find Will. The world hadn't exploded into ten different storylines yet, the tension stayed insane. \n\nThe scale being small did wonders. One missing kid. One group of boys. One grieving mom. One girl with powers. One shady lab. That\u2019s it. And somehow it felt massive because the stakes were so personal.\n\nNo matter how big the show gets, that first season is always going to feel like lightning in a bottle. It set the tone perfectly. And this is why Season 2 is my 2nd favourite Season, it had the essence of Season 1. \n\nSeason 2 is the closest the show ever got to recapturing that formula. It felt like Hawkins wasn\u2019t drowning in plot threads unlike the later seasons. The characters were dealing with the fallout of Season 1, everyone was still connected, the tone stayed grounded, and Will\u2019s possession arc was just so damn strong.", "timestamp": 1763737787, "label": "ERROR"}

{"original_topic": "breaking_bad", "comment": "Daily reminder that neither Mike nor Walt were \"right\" or \"wrong\", they were both pretty terrible people I saw a post yesterday about how Mike was wrong in his argument against Walt about how they had a good thing and Walt blew it up. I actually don't disagree with everything said about Mike's \"points\". I agree with a lot of it. \n\nI think Gus had Tomas murdered or at least knew that's what the dealers would do. Think about it. Gus' big thing is that his people don't operate without his consent or knowledge. Gus liked these dealers so much, he risked his relationship with Walt to protect them. There's no way they did that without Gus having at least mild knowledge of it. I think it was a play to get Jesse killed. Jesse goes to retaliate, believing Walt wouldn't care or react or even know about it until Jesse had already gone to the dealers. They were already waiting for him, Jesse gets gunned down and Gus consoles Walt after having the dealers killed by Mike for killing Tomas and causing the situation to begin with. Now Gus has Walt, his perfect lab and no more \"junkie\". Walt knew this, he figured it out and literally told Gus that hypothetically Jesse might have believed it was Gus' doing. The show writers wouldn't have Walt say this unless they wanted us to think about it. \n\nBut does that make Walt the good guy? Or Mike? No. Mike wanted to kill Jesse for a long time. He wanted to kill Jesse just for doing drugs after his girlfriend died. Literally told Walt, \"Let me take care of it\" intending to kill Jesse at a drug house when he was consumed with grief. The same Mike that we're supposed to believe saw Jesse as a son. \n\nOn the flip side, Mike figured Walt out and knew exactly what kind of man Walt was. Walt isn't a saint. He kept Jesse alive for his own selfish reasons. He used Jesse, manipulated him, took advantage of him. And let's not forget... Walt caused Jane to turn over and choke and then stood there while she choked. Walt is also the reason they got mixed up with Gus to begin with. \n\nHere's the list of garbage moves Walt made that caused Jesse's life to get progressively worse at every turn: \n\n1. When they were making cash hand over fist, Walt freaked out about Skinny Pete getting mugged which is absolutely a thing that dealers have to deal with. This put Jesse in a compromising situation for a wad of cash that they could easily make back on the back end. No retaliation is bad for business? You can retaliate in other ways. Black list those \"customers\" and they'll find a way to pay you back. Like Jesse said, they had the best product and no one else was dealing because Tuco was dead. \n\n2. After Jesse gets caught up in a situation that leads to a man's death, he starts getting cocky and pushes for them to expand. He tries to act like a know it all, pulling out a map and *teaching* Jesse, the one who is in charge of business, new areas to expand to. Jesse literally warns him that going into new territory will lead to violent encounters but Walt is happy to milk the MISBELIEF that Jesse killed Spooge even though he knows Jesse and his crew are no killers. At this point, they don't even have junior dealers working for Badger, Skinny Pete or Combo. \n\n3. Every single thing that Jesse warned Walt about happens. First, Badger gets arrested which costs them $80k to resolve. This also loses them a dealer. And then, disaster: Combo gets killed. Where? In new territory where Gus' dealers are. This means they're down two dealers and only have Skinny Pete. And he naturally wants out because Combo is dead. This also puts Jesse under tremendous stress which leads to him leaning heavily into drugs. Walt starts worrying about how they're going to sell 50 pounds of product, but he doesn't seem AT ALL worried about Jesse. He finagles a deal with a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy and manages to get a deal to sell all of his product to Gus. At this point, there's no doubt that Gus is most likely buying it just to get it off the market. \n\nThe entire reason they end up in business with Gus, the entire reason Combo was killed by Gus' dealers, the entire reason this whole business deal with Gus even starts is due to **WALT'S EGO**. His ego is also what led to them having their run-in with Tuco. Walt was angry about $1500-$2000 a day being too slow for him and wanted to sell to a distributor. Walt was angry about needing pseudo for a traditional cook so he concocted the plan to steal methylamine. Out of everyone, Gus and Walt are the only ones who didn't want to \"get out\" of the business. \n\nMike was a lot of things, and up until he finally warmed up to Jesse, he was a piece of shit in a lot of ways, but he wasn't in the business to be in the business. He was happy to get out ahead at various points in the series. Him and Jesse were willing to walk away, sell their shares of the methylamine and walk away with more money than they could've earned in a lifetime. But who wanted to stay? Walt. \n\nIt's easy to see Walt as the reasonable one who wanted to help Jesse. But it's important to understand that almost every time Walt \"saved\" Jesse, he was saving Jesse from a horrible situation that **he himself** put Jesse in.", "timestamp": 1763737788, "label": "ERROR"}

It's all relative and based on perspectives. The same way people didn't know that the Beatles' discography only lasted about 7 years, because each album/image of the band was so different from one another.\n\n Breaking Bad happens to have a lot of events and multiple perspectives told through a lot of characters (who evolve a lot throughout the course of the series) with depths to them.

So I think most of you are aware that the show is scheduled to leave Netflix altogether in roughly a month.  \n\nI am running through the series, but I started about three months ago and am currently at the midway point of season 9.  What I want to ask you guys is, I won\u2019t be able to finish the series in the time left mostly because I have a life and would need to watch multiple hours per day to finish it.  But I have heard about two episodes that not only sound super interesting, but also get great IMDb ratings that I\u2019m really interested in watching:  \u201cScoobynatural\u201c and \u201cBaby.\u201d  Can I watch those right now, or at least very soon, and not be spoiling anything?  In other words, will I be able to watch it and enjoy/understand it without first burning through the series from where I am now?\n\nI appreciate the advice while avoiding spoilers from post season 9.   I\u2019m also open to recs of other great later episodes that stand on their own, though given the time restraints I would need to be picky to weed out the lesser stuff from the great ones. \n\nAlso, one last thing; it sucks that Netflix is losing the show.  But there may be a tiny sliver of hope in that it\u2019s been reported that Netflix is privately in communication with the owners of Warner Bros, which is up for sale.   They are interested in purchasing WB, but at this current stage they\u2019re just feeling out their options versus other potential buyers to see if it\u2019s feasible not only for themselves but for WB seller.  And of course, if they can purchase WB they would be outright getting the rights for Supernatural amongst their entire vast catalogue.  It probably won\u2019t happen soon, but it could still happen.

There's this episode, Azazel feeding demon blood to six-month old Sam, the woman in white basically force-kissing and abusing Sam in the pilot, Meg possessing Sam in S2E14, Ruby exploiting him with demon blood in season 4, the two hunters literally forcing demon blood down Sam's throat while physically restraining him in S5E3, that whole Becky plot in S7E8, and more.

For a while now, I\u2019ve noticed that a boy in my class behaves in a certain way towards me, and I\u2019m not sure how to interpret it. Here are the facts:\n\n1. **At the beginning of the school year**, he often tried to make eye contact with me. I\u2019m very shy, so I avoided it. Then, he started calling me *Baka* (a Japanese word for \"idiot\") discreetly, but I could clearly hear him.\n2. **As time went on, his behavior changed**. During a school trip, on the bus, he suddenly said: *\"Wesh \\[my name\\], how are you!?\"* Then, he kept looking at me. Every time I looked at him, he would look away, and when I turned back to the window, he would look at me again. This went on for a while until I got too embarrassed and turned completely away.\n3. **One day in class**, I was talking to his little sister (we\u2019ve become friends) a bit away from the group. When we decided to rejoin the others, he suddenly rushed towards my friend, stopped abruptly when he saw me, and then went back to his friends.\n4. **His little sister told me things about him**. She said he talked about me at home, saying that at the beginning of the year, he had certain thoughts about me, but now it\u2019s better. He also said that I was nice and that I didn\u2019t talk to boys, which made me a \"good Muslim.\" He asked her not to tell me, but of course, she did.\n5. **One day, he asked if I was Moroccan**. I replied a bit curtly (I regret it). My friend later told me that before I arrived, he was talking to his friend about wanting to focus on his projects, but as soon as I walked in, he asked me that question.\n6. **Recently, while I was handing out papers in class**, he suddenly turned towards me and whispered something to his friend.\n7. **Another time, he asked me:** *\"Are you going to defend me at the class council?\"* (I\u2019m just an eco-delegate and not involved in the class council). Right after asking, he left without waiting for an answer.\n\nI\u2019m confused. He seems comfortable talking to other girls, but with me, he acts distant and ambiguous. Do you think he might be interested in me, or am I reading too much into this? How should I react?\n\nThank you in advance for your advice!\n\nAsk me questions if some points are not clear :)", "timestamp": 1763737788, "label": "ERROR"}

The Alpha werewolf lore feels like it was made up in 5 minutes, and the Hyde lore isn\u2019t much better.

In the novella, Dr. Henry Jekyll develops a potion to separate his good and evil sides. When he drinks it, he transforms into evil Edward Hyde. Over time, Jekyll's transformations become more frequent and involuntary. The novella ends with Jekyll's final, unchangeable transformation into Hyde, who then commits suicide.\u00a0Throughout the story, Jekyll remembers everything he does as Hyde. Hyde is not a separate personality that takes over Jekyll's consciousness; rather, Hyde is Jekyll acting without his usual inhibitions, and Jekyll is fully aware of Hyde's actions. Essentially,\u00a0Jekyll tries to use the transformation to indulge in his darker impulses.\n\nThat\u2019s a very cool concept. And in Season 1, it seemed like the show was going in that direction. Tyler\u2019s first transformations are triggered by Laurel\u2019s chemicals. Maybe not at first, but over time, he becomes fully aware of his actions as a Hyde and starts enjoying them, because they give him the freedom to act on impulses he normally suppresses. That tracks with the original novella. But then the show adds lore that honestly makes everything messier: the **\u201cmaster\u201d**.\n\nAt first, I get it; writers needed a way to justify Laurel controlling Tyler and tie the twist together. Fine. But Season 2 introduces Tyler\u2019s mother, and suddenly the whole \u201cmaster\u201d concept becomes a narrative roadblock. So now apparently female Hydes don\u2019t need a master, only male Hydes do. BUT the master\u2019s control seems optional because Tyler kills Laurel and fights his own mother, AND male Hydes supposedly go \u201cinsane\u201d without a master, AND they still die young because each transformation shortens their lifespan. It really sucks being a male hyena. I mean Hyde.\n\nSo\u2026 what does a \u201cmaster\u201d even mean anymore?\n\nIt just feels *messy.* I wish they had stuck closer to the original Jekyll-and-Hyde idea rather than constantly adding plot-convenient rules that contradict earlier ones. And it\u2019s not just Hydes. The Alpha werewolf lore is equally vague and inconsistent.\n\nSeason 3 is going to expand the Hyde/werewolf lore even more with Capri and her mix of Hydes and werewolves, and honestly? I\u2019m scared that by the end of it, things are going to be even more convoluted than they already are, when they really don\u2019t need to be.\n\nAlso, as I was finishing typing all of this, I remembered that in Season 1, Xavier had some weird psychic connection to Tyler/Hyde, which the show never explained. But I guess we\u2019re never going to learn how or why that worked. Oh well\u2026\n\nJust some of my thoughts. What do you guys think about Hydes and how the show handles their lore?", "timestamp": 1763737788, "label": "ERROR"}

{"original_topic": "wednesday", "comment": "Why Wenclair Doesn\u2019t Click for Me Anymore- as a huge fan of the ship after s1 I\u2019ve been trying really hard to figure out why Wenclair doesn\u2019t hit for me anymore, especially because I *want* to love them the way I did back in season one. I genuinely enjoyed their dynamic at first. Their contrast felt natural, their growth felt earned, and the whole \u201cOpessites attract\u201d trope actually worked really well. They had softness, tension, vulnerability, and all these tiny moments that made their connection feel warm and meaningful. I really believed in the version of them that season one was building.\n\nBut after S1, something changed for me, and it\u2019s been harder than I expected to reconnect with the ship. In season two, the relationship that hooked me just\u2026 wasn\u2019t there in the same way. They spent a lot of their scenes either arguing, miscommunicating, or being emotionally out of sync, and I never felt like the show gave them the time to rebuild or deepen the connection they started with. Even when they *did* have an emotional moment, like right before switching their bodies back, it didn\u2019t carry that same spark or weight from S1. It felt more like a leftover of what they used to be rather than a continuation of what they could\u2019ve become.\n\nI\u2019m not saying the writing was malicious or that the characters stopped caring about each other, but the shift in their dynamic made it harder for me to see the romantic potential that used to stand out so clearly. Instead of growing closer, it felt like they drifted apart, and the emotional thread between them got thinner instead of stronger. And when a ship relies heavily on chemistry, softness, and contrast, that shift really affects how you connect with it.\n\nI also want to be clear: this isn\u2019t an attack on Wenclair or the people who love it. I completely understand why the ship is meaningful to so many fans, and I think the version of Wenclair in season one was genuinely compelling. I\u2019m not trying to take that away from anyone. I\u2019m just being honest about my own experience: after S1, the show didn\u2019t give me the same feeling or energy that originally made me see their relationship in a romantic light.\n\nThe frustrating part is that I *wish* I still shipped it. I wish I could recapture that spark I felt the first time around. I wish I could go back to seeing what everyone else still sees. But the shift in how they were written in S2 changed the way I interpreted their dynamic, and no matter how much I try to get that old feeling back, I can\u2019t force it.\n\nSo this isn\u2019t a hate post, or a dismissal, or some superiority compex thing. It\u2019s just me admitting that the version of Wenclair I connected to isn\u2019t really present anymore, at least not for me. And I really wish that wasn\u2019t the case.", "timestamp": 1763737788, "label": "ERROR"}

Outside of just the writing though, I mean these people have waited SO LONG to release the next season, it\u2019s gonna be 4 years by the time the new season comes out.

{"original_topic": "wednesday", "comment": "I really wish Tyler and the other Hydes were written more like actual Jekyll-and-Hyde monsters Basically, exactly what the title says. A lot of the writing in this show is\u2026 let\u2019s call it \u201cwonky,\u201d and the show's lore suffers from it. The Alpha werewolf lore feels like it was made up in 5 minutes, and the Hyde lore isn\u2019t much better. The show dedicated two seasons to Hydes, and it still feels all over the place.\n\nHydes are clearly inspired by Robert Louis Stevenson's novella *The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde*. In the novella, Dr. Henry Jekyll develops a potion to separate his good and evil sides. When he drinks it, he transforms into evil Edward Hyde. Over time, Jekyll's transformations become more frequent and involuntary. The novella ends with Jekyll's final, unchangeable transformation into Hyde, who then commits suicide.\u00a0Throughout the story, Jekyll remembers everything he does as Hyde. Hyde is not a separate personality that takes over Jekyll's consciousness; rather, Hyde is Jekyll acting without his usual inhibitions, and Jekyll is fully aware of Hyde's actions. Essentially,\u00a0Jekyll tries to use the transformation to indulge in his darker impulses.\n\nThat\u2019s a very cool concept. And in Season 1, it seemed like the show was going in that direction. Tyler\u2019s first transformations are triggered by Laurel\u2019s chemicals. Maybe not at first, but over time, he becomes fully aware of his actions as a Hyde and starts enjoying them, because they give him the freedom to act on impulses he normally suppresses. That tracks with the original novella. But then the show adds lore that honestly makes everything messier: the **\u201cmaster\u201d**.\n\nAt first, I get it; writers needed a way to justify Laurel controlling Tyler and tie the twist together. Fine. But Season 2 introduces Tyler\u2019s mother, and suddenly the whole \u201cmaster\u201d concept becomes a narrative roadblock. So now apparently female Hydes don\u2019t need a master, only male Hydes do. BUT the master\u2019s control seems optional because Tyler kills Laurel and fights his own mother, AND male Hydes supposedly go \u201cinsane\u201d without a master, AND they still die young because each transformation shortens their lifespan. It really sucks being a male hyena. I mean Hyde.\n\nSo\u2026 what does a \u201cmaster\u201d even mean anymore?\n\nIt just feels *messy.* I wish they had stuck closer to the original Jekyll-and-Hyde idea rather than constantly adding plot-convenient rules that contradict earlier ones. And it\u2019s not just Hydes. The Alpha werewolf lore is equally vague and inconsistent.\n\nSeason 3 is going to expand the Hyde/werewolf lore even more with Capri and her mix of Hydes and werewolves, and honestly? I\u2019m scared that by the end of it, things are going to be even more convoluted than they already are, when they really don\u2019t need to be.\n\nAlso, as I was finishing typing all of this, I remembered that in Season 1, Xavier had some weird psychic connection to Tyler/Hyde, which the show never explained. But I guess we\u2019re never going to learn how or why that worked. Oh well\u2026\n\nJust some of my thoughts. What do you guys think about Hydes and how the show handles their lore?", "timestamp": 1763738308, "label": "ERROR"}

{"original_topic": "wednesday", "comment": "Why Wenclair Doesn\u2019t Click for Me Anymore- as a huge fan of the ship after s1 I\u2019ve been trying really hard to figure out why Wenclair doesn\u2019t hit for me anymore, especially because I *want* to love them the way I did back in season one. I genuinely enjoyed their dynamic at first. Their contrast felt natural, their growth felt earned, and the whole \u201cOpessites attract\u201d trope actually worked really well. They had softness, tension, vulnerability, and all these tiny moments that made their connection feel warm and meaningful. I really believed in the version of them that season one was building.\n\nBut after S1, something changed for me, and it\u2019s been harder than I expected to reconnect with the ship. In season two, the relationship that hooked me just\u2026 wasn\u2019t there in the same way. They spent a lot of their scenes either arguing, miscommunicating, or being emotionally out of sync, and I never felt like the show gave them the time to rebuild or deepen the connection they started with. Even when they *did* have an emotional moment, like right before switching their bodies back, it didn\u2019t carry that same spark or weight from S1. It felt more like a leftover of what they used to be rather than a continuation of what they could\u2019ve become.\n\nI\u2019m not saying the writing was malicious or that the characters stopped caring about each other, but the shift in their dynamic made it harder for me to see the romantic potential that used to stand out so clearly. Instead of growing closer, it felt like they drifted apart, and the emotional thread between them got thinner instead of stronger. And when a ship relies heavily on chemistry, softness, and contrast, that shift really affects how you connect with it.\n\nI also want to be clear: this isn\u2019t an attack on Wenclair or the people who love it. I completely understand why the ship is meaningful to so many fans, and I think the version of Wenclair in season one was genuinely compelling. I\u2019m not trying to take that away from anyone. I\u2019m just being honest about my own experience: after S1, the show didn\u2019t give me the same feeling or energy that originally made me see their relationship in a romantic light.\n\nThe frustrating part is that I *wish* I still shipped it. I wish I could recapture that spark I felt the first time around. I wish I could go back to seeing what everyone else still sees. But the shift in how they were written in S2 changed the way I interpreted their dynamic, and no matter how much I try to get that old feeling back, I can\u2019t force it.\n\nSo this isn\u2019t a hate post, or a dismissal, or some superiority compex thing. It\u2019s just me admitting that the version of Wenclair I connected to isn\u2019t really present anymore, at least not for me. And I really wish that wasn\u2019t the case.", "timestamp": 1763738308, "label": "ERROR"}

{"original_topic": "adolescence", "comment": "Need advice about a boy at my school Hi,\n\nI\u2019m a 14-year-old girl, and I\u2019m new at my school. For a while now, I\u2019ve noticed that a boy in my class behaves in a certain way towards me, and I\u2019m not sure how to interpret it. Here are the facts:\n\n1. **At the beginning of the school year**, he often tried to make eye contact with me. I\u2019m very shy, so I avoided it. Then, he started calling me *Baka* (a Japanese word for \"idiot\") discreetly, but I could clearly hear him.\n2. **As time went on, his behavior changed**. During a school trip, on the bus, he suddenly said: *\"Wesh \\[my name\\], how are you!?\"* Then, he kept looking at me. Every time I looked at him, he would look away, and when I turned back to the window, he would look at me again. This went on for a while until I got too embarrassed and turned completely away.\n3. **One day in class**, I was talking to his little sister (we\u2019ve become friends) a bit away from the group. When we decided to rejoin the others, he suddenly rushed towards my friend, stopped abruptly when he saw me, and then went back to his friends.\n4. **His little sister told me things about him**. She said he talked about me at home, saying that at the beginning of the year, he had certain thoughts about me, but now it\u2019s better. He also said that I was nice and that I didn\u2019t talk to boys, which made me a \"good Muslim.\" He asked her not to tell me, but of course, she did.\n5. **One day, he asked if I was Moroccan**. I replied a bit curtly (I regret it). My friend later told me that before I arrived, he was talking to his friend about wanting to focus on his projects, but as soon as I walked in, he asked me that question.\n6. **Recently, while I was handing out papers in class**, he suddenly turned towards me and whispered something to his friend.\n7. **Another time, he asked me:** *\"Are you going to defend me at the class council?\"* (I\u2019m just an eco-delegate and not involved in the class council). Right after asking, he left without waiting for an answer.\n\nI\u2019m confused. He seems comfortable talking to other girls, but with me, he acts distant and ambiguous. Do you think he might be interested in me, or am I reading too much into this? How should I react?\n\nThank you in advance for your advice!\n\nAsk me questions if some points are not clear :)", "timestamp": 1763738308, "label": "ERROR"}

Even if she underwent a lot of issues with her parents and Billy but she was so mean with Lucas when he tried to tell her about the Upside Down. I get that not everyone would believe such a story and it sounded stupid something as the Upside Down exists and Will's issue, etc but still - Lucas had to keep proving himself to her all the time. \n\n\n\nThen he kept calling out Dustin about Suzie and even made his friends give up on him, pretending she knows everything again.\n\n  \nThen she influenced El - though she was right that El should have her own life and needn't do everything Mike said but she like kept telling El to dump Mike and doing stuff that made Mike and El distance themselves, it felt wrong. She was always with an attitude over everything in all seasons. \n\n\n\nThen in season 4 she just ignores everyone.

He went from being a selfish, jealous bully to the best goddamn babysitter on the planet! Ever since he saw the Demogorgon at the Byers house in S1, he has become such a good guy. He is fiercely protective about those he cares about, especially the younger kids, who he often has to help protect as they go through with their VERY dangerous plans to combat the Upside Down.\n\nIn S4, he tells Nancy he's been thinking about what he wants his life to look like after this is all over. He's always dreamed of having a wife and 6 kids, packing them into an RV, and driving around the country to see the Grand Canyon and other great wonders of the world. He later admits to Nancy in the Upside Down that she is the wife he's been dreaming of. He has never fully gotten over her.\n\nWhile Nancy does care about Steve a lot, she has a boyfriend despite their issues and she only sees Steve as a close friend. You can tell by the look on her face she was hoping he wouldn't say that. And not only that, but Steve's dream sounds like a nightmare for someone as driven as Nancy. To have 6 kids at that point in time, Nancy would have to be a stay at home mom. And she seems like someone who would want her own career to feel fulfilled, like becoming a journalist.\n\nSomething many fans don't realize is that Steve's dream has already come true, just not in the way he had thought. He did in fact drive around in an RV with Nancy and 6 kids to prepare to go after Vecna. That sounds like an incredible setup for an absolutely devastating death.\n\nDo you think Steve will die? Will he sacrifice himself to save one of the kids or even Nancy herself? Is Steve dying the reason why Nancy is crying and washing blood off her hands in the S5 trailer? I know most fans would be heartbroken over this and I do not want it to happen, but it seems probable that it could happen.", "timestamp": 1763738308, "label": "ERROR"}

Zero second of fillers and the storyline is just so packed and well paced. \n\nThe show had this perfect balance of mystery, horror, thrill and heart back then. Season 1 feels like lightning in a bottle. Small town, small cast and one central mission, find Will. The world hadn't exploded into ten different storylines yet, the tension stayed insane. \n\nThe scale being small did wonders. One missing kid. One group of boys. One grieving mom. One girl with powers. One shady lab. That\u2019s it. And somehow it felt massive because the stakes were so personal.\n\nNo matter how big the show gets, that first season is always going to feel like lightning in a bottle. It set the tone perfectly. And this is why Season 2 is my 2nd favourite Season, it had the essence of Season 1. \n\nSeason 2 is the closest the show ever got to recapturing that formula. It felt like Hawkins wasn\u2019t drowning in plot threads unlike the later seasons. The characters were dealing with the fallout of Season 1, everyone was still connected, the tone stayed grounded, and Will\u2019s possession arc was just so damn strong.", "timestamp": 1763738309, "label": "ERROR"}

{"original_topic": "euphoria", "comment": "Euphoria really destroyed its potential Hey y\u2019all, so I was bored and decided to rewatch Euphoria, and dang guys season 1 is literally so peak. I really feel like Euphoria stands out from all these other high school dramas because the aesthetic and cinematography is just beautiful, not to mention that I also feel like the characters are super realistic (not so much the whole high school aspect because every one of these bitches would be dress coded in two seconds if it was the real world lol) but just the way the characters think and feel, I mean I\u2019m in college now but when season 1 first came out, I was a sophomore in high school and the characters were just so relatable to me.\n\nBut I\u2019m not gonna lie, Euphoria really just wasted away all of its potential with season 2 and how they\u2019re treating the release of season 3. First of all, season 2 was lowkey trash. There wasn\u2019t much in the way of character development or just overall storyline, and after rewatching season 2, it really just feels kind of dragged on. When the hype was going on for season 2, people treated this show like it could do no wrong and so did I, but now I really just feel like season 2 is pretty bad. Lexi\u2019s play was also so unnecessary, like I get that they were trying to show how she was coming out of her shell and stuff, but I feel like they could have done that in a much better way, we as the audience really didn\u2019t need a whole recap of the events of season 1 in a school play that would have never been allowed to exist in a real school. Outside of just the writing though, I mean these people have waited SO LONG to release the next season, it\u2019s gonna be 4 years by the time the new season comes out. I know there were unexpected deaths from the cast which is just a tragedy, but it\u2019s been so long and there\u2019s so many people missing in the show now that I feel like people aren\u2019t even excited about this show anymore, and they should lowkey just call it good, but of course they\u2019re gonna milk it financially for all that it\u2019s worth.

{"original_topic": "breaking_bad", "comment": "Daily reminder that neither Mike nor Walt were \"right\" or \"wrong\", they were both pretty terrible people I saw a post yesterday about how Mike was wrong in his argument against Walt about how they had a good thing and Walt blew it up. I actually don't disagree with everything said about Mike's \"points\". I agree with a lot of it. \n\nI think Gus had Tomas murdered or at least knew that's what the dealers would do. Think about it. Gus' big thing is that his people don't operate without his consent or knowledge. Gus liked these dealers so much, he risked his relationship with Walt to protect them. There's no way they did that without Gus having at least mild knowledge of it. I think it was a play to get Jesse killed. Jesse goes to retaliate, believing Walt wouldn't care or react or even know about it until Jesse had already gone to the dealers. They were already waiting for him, Jesse gets gunned down and Gus consoles Walt after having the dealers killed by Mike for killing Tomas and causing the situation to begin with. Now Gus has Walt, his perfect lab and no more \"junkie\". Walt knew this, he figured it out and literally told Gus that hypothetically Jesse might have believed it was Gus' doing. The show writers wouldn't have Walt say this unless they wanted us to think about it. \n\nBut does that make Walt the good guy? Or Mike? No. Mike wanted to kill Jesse for a long time. He wanted to kill Jesse just for doing drugs after his girlfriend died. Literally told Walt, \"Let me take care of it\" intending to kill Jesse at a drug house when he was consumed with grief. The same Mike that we're supposed to believe saw Jesse as a son. \n\nOn the flip side, Mike figured Walt out and knew exactly what kind of man Walt was. Walt isn't a saint. He kept Jesse alive for his own selfish reasons. He used Jesse, manipulated him, took advantage of him. And let's not forget... Walt caused Jane to turn over and choke and then stood there while she choked. Walt is also the reason they got mixed up with Gus to begin with. \n\nHere's the list of garbage moves Walt made that caused Jesse's life to get progressively worse at every turn: \n\n1. When they were making cash hand over fist, Walt freaked out about Skinny Pete getting mugged which is absolutely a thing that dealers have to deal with. This put Jesse in a compromising situation for a wad of cash that they could easily make back on the back end. No retaliation is bad for business? You can retaliate in other ways. Black list those \"customers\" and they'll find a way to pay you back. Like Jesse said, they had the best product and no one else was dealing because Tuco was dead. \n\n2. After Jesse gets caught up in a situation that leads to a man's death, he starts getting cocky and pushes for them to expand. He tries to act like a know it all, pulling out a map and *teaching* Jesse, the one who is in charge of business, new areas to expand to. Jesse literally warns him that going into new territory will lead to violent encounters but Walt is happy to milk the MISBELIEF that Jesse killed Spooge even though he knows Jesse and his crew are no killers. At this point, they don't even have junior dealers working for Badger, Skinny Pete or Combo. \n\n3. Every single thing that Jesse warned Walt about happens. First, Badger gets arrested which costs them $80k to resolve. This also loses them a dealer. And then, disaster: Combo gets killed. Where? In new territory where Gus' dealers are. This means they're down two dealers and only have Skinny Pete. And he naturally wants out because Combo is dead. This also puts Jesse under tremendous stress which leads to him leaning heavily into drugs. Walt starts worrying about how they're going to sell 50 pounds of product, but he doesn't seem AT ALL worried about Jesse. He finagles a deal with a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy and manages to get a deal to sell all of his product to Gus. At this point, there's no doubt that Gus is most likely buying it just to get it off the market. \n\nThe entire reason they end up in business with Gus, the entire reason Combo was killed by Gus' dealers, the entire reason this whole business deal with Gus even starts is due to **WALT'S EGO**. His ego is also what led to them having their run-in with Tuco. Walt was angry about $1500-$2000 a day being too slow for him and wanted to sell to a distributor. Walt was angry about needing pseudo for a traditional cook so he concocted the plan to steal methylamine. Out of everyone, Gus and Walt are the only ones who didn't want to \"get out\" of the business. \n\nMike was a lot of things, and up until he finally warmed up to Jesse, he was a piece of shit in a lot of ways, but he wasn't in the business to be in the business. He was happy to get out ahead at various points in the series. Him and Jesse were willing to walk away, sell their shares of the methylamine and walk away with more money than they could've earned in a lifetime. But who wanted to stay? Walt. \n\nIt's easy to see Walt as the reasonable one who wanted to help Jesse. But it's important to understand that almost every time Walt \"saved\" Jesse, he was saving Jesse from a horrible situation that **he himself** put Jesse in.", "timestamp": 1763738309, "label": "ERROR"}

{"original_topic": "breaking_bad", "comment": "Majority of the show happened in 1 year - and that's actually pretty realistic As most fans have figured that the majority of Breaking Bad happened in 2 years - with one year covering the first 4 seasons and first 3 episodes of season 5 and the remaining year was 13 episodes - some have said that this timeline is ridiculously unrealistic, but IMO it makes total sense, especially during binge watches. \n\nFrom my real life experiences, a lot can happen in one year, and sometimes 3-4 years and nothing changes besides that your best friend broke up with his girlfriend or your local Los Pollos joint gets shut down. It's all relative and based on perspectives. The same way people didn't know that the Beatles' discography only lasted about 7 years, because each album/image of the band was so different from one another.\n\n Breaking Bad happens to have a lot of events and multiple perspectives told through a lot of characters (who evolve a lot throughout the course of the series) with depths to them. That gives us the illusion that the show would be like 3-4 years in total.", "timestamp": 1763738309, "label": "ERROR"}

For a while now, I\u2019ve noticed that a boy in my class behaves in a certain way towards me, and I\u2019m not sure how to interpret it. Here are the facts:\n\n1. **At the beginning of the school year**, he often tried to make eye contact with me. I\u2019m very shy, so I avoided it. Then, he started calling me *Baka* (a Japanese word for \"idiot\") discreetly, but I could clearly hear him.\n2. **As time went on, his behavior changed**. During a school trip, on the bus, he suddenly said: *\"Wesh \\[my name\\], how are you!?\"* Then, he kept looking at me. Every time I looked at him, he would look away, and when I turned back to the window, he would look at me again. This went on for a while until I got too embarrassed and turned completely away.\n3. **One day in class**, I was talking to his little sister (we\u2019ve become friends) a bit away from the group. When we decided to rejoin the others, he suddenly rushed towards my friend, stopped abruptly when he saw me, and then went back to his friends.\n4. **His little sister told me things about him**. She said he talked about me at home, saying that at the beginning of the year, he had certain thoughts about me, but now it\u2019s better. He also said that I was nice and that I didn\u2019t talk to boys, which made me a \"good Muslim.\" He asked her not to tell me, but of course, she did.\n5. **One day, he asked if I was Moroccan**. I replied a bit curtly (I regret it). My friend later told me that before I arrived, he was talking to his friend about wanting to focus on his projects, but as soon as I walked in, he asked me that question.\n6. **Recently, while I was handing out papers in class**, he suddenly turned towards me and whispered something to his friend.\n7. **Another time, he asked me:** *\"Are you going to defend me at the class council?\"* (I\u2019m just an eco-delegate and not involved in the class council). Right after asking, he left without waiting for an answer.\n\nI\u2019m confused. He seems comfortable talking to other girls, but with me, he acts distant and ambiguous. Do you think he might be interested in me, or am I reading too much into this? How should I react?\n\nThank you in advance for your advice!\n\nAsk me questions if some points are not clear :)", "timestamp": 1763739179, "label": "ERROR"}

{"original_topic": "breaking_bad", "comment": "Daily reminder that neither Mike nor Walt were \"right\" or \"wrong\", they were both pretty terrible people I saw a post yesterday about how Mike was wrong in his argument against Walt about how they had a good thing and Walt blew it up. I actually don't disagree with everything said about Mike's \"points\". I agree with a lot of it. \n\nI think Gus had Tomas murdered or at least knew that's what the dealers would do. Think about it. Gus' big thing is that his people don't operate without his consent or knowledge. Gus liked these dealers so much, he risked his relationship with Walt to protect them. There's no way they did that without Gus having at least mild knowledge of it. I think it was a play to get Jesse killed. Jesse goes to retaliate, believing Walt wouldn't care or react or even know about it until Jesse had already gone to the dealers. They were already waiting for him, Jesse gets gunned down and Gus consoles Walt after having the dealers killed by Mike for killing Tomas and causing the situation to begin with. Now Gus has Walt, his perfect lab and no more \"junkie\". Walt knew this, he figured it out and literally told Gus that hypothetically Jesse might have believed it was Gus' doing. The show writers wouldn't have Walt say this unless they wanted us to think about it. \n\nBut does that make Walt the good guy? Or Mike? No. Mike wanted to kill Jesse for a long time. He wanted to kill Jesse just for doing drugs after his girlfriend died. Literally told Walt, \"Let me take care of it\" intending to kill Jesse at a drug house when he was consumed with grief. The same Mike that we're supposed to believe saw Jesse as a son. \n\nOn the flip side, Mike figured Walt out and knew exactly what kind of man Walt was. Walt isn't a saint. He kept Jesse alive for his own selfish reasons. He used Jesse, manipulated him, took advantage of him. And let's not forget... Walt caused Jane to turn over and choke and then stood there while she choked. Walt is also the reason they got mixed up with Gus to begin with. \n\nHere's the list of garbage moves Walt made that caused Jesse's life to get progressively worse at every turn: \n\n1. When they were making cash hand over fist, Walt freaked out about Skinny Pete getting mugged which is absolutely a thing that dealers have to deal with. This put Jesse in a compromising situation for a wad of cash that they could easily make back on the back end. No retaliation is bad for business? You can retaliate in other ways. Black list those \"customers\" and they'll find a way to pay you back. Like Jesse said, they had the best product and no one else was dealing because Tuco was dead. \n\n2. After Jesse gets caught up in a situation that leads to a man's death, he starts getting cocky and pushes for them to expand. He tries to act like a know it all, pulling out a map and *teaching* Jesse, the one who is in charge of business, new areas to expand to. Jesse literally warns him that going into new territory will lead to violent encounters but Walt is happy to milk the MISBELIEF that Jesse killed Spooge even though he knows Jesse and his crew are no killers. At this point, they don't even have junior dealers working for Badger, Skinny Pete or Combo. \n\n3. Every single thing that Jesse warned Walt about happens. First, Badger gets arrested which costs them $80k to resolve. This also loses them a dealer. And then, disaster: Combo gets killed. Where? In new territory where Gus' dealers are. This means they're down two dealers and only have Skinny Pete. And he naturally wants out because Combo is dead. This also puts Jesse under tremendous stress which leads to him leaning heavily into drugs. Walt starts worrying about how they're going to sell 50 pounds of product, but he doesn't seem AT ALL worried about Jesse. He finagles a deal with a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy and manages to get a deal to sell all of his product to Gus. At this point, there's no doubt that Gus is most likely buying it just to get it off the market. \n\nThe entire reason they end up in business with Gus, the entire reason Combo was killed by Gus' dealers, the entire reason this whole business deal with Gus even starts is due to **WALT'S EGO**. His ego is also what led to them having their run-in with Tuco. Walt was angry about $1500-$2000 a day being too slow for him and wanted to sell to a distributor. Walt was angry about needing pseudo for a traditional cook so he concocted the plan to steal methylamine. Out of everyone, Gus and Walt are the only ones who didn't want to \"get out\" of the business. \n\nMike was a lot of things, and up until he finally warmed up to Jesse, he was a piece of shit in a lot of ways, but he wasn't in the business to be in the business.

I remember in high school when Tumblr was huge how big the show was and how much hype was behind it. I'm not really a huge tv person nor do I usually give into the hype of things but a few months ago I was looking up \"best television series of all time\" and of course Breaking Bad was consistently mentioned as being #1. I'm so happy I finally got around to watching the series, I'm just sad that I'm so late. The entire cast was phenomenal, every episode from the very first one pulled me into and kept me surprised, entertained and yet astonished at how beautifully it was shot. I can't even explain how incredible this show is. I hope Vince or Bryan or Aaron write a novel about the experience of it all some day.

It's all relative and based on perspectives. The same way people didn't know that the Beatles' discography only lasted about 7 years, because each album/image of the band was so different from one another.\n\n Breaking Bad happens to have a lot of events and multiple perspectives told through a lot of characters (who evolve a lot throughout the course of the series) with depths to them.

I really feel like Euphoria stands out from all these other high school dramas because the aesthetic and cinematography is just beautiful, not to mention that I also feel like the characters are super realistic (not so much the whole high school aspect because every one of these bitches would be dress coded in two seconds if it was the real world lol) but just the way the characters think and feel, I mean I\u2019m in college now but when season 1 first came out, I was a sophomore in high school and the characters were just so relatable to me.\n\nBut I\u2019m not gonna lie, Euphoria really just wasted away all of its potential with season 2 and how they\u2019re treating the release of season 3. First of all, season 2 was lowkey trash. There wasn\u2019t much in the way of character development or just overall storyline, and after rewatching season 2, it really just feels kind of dragged on. When the hype was going on for season 2, people treated this show like it could do no wrong and so did I, but now I really just feel like season 2 is pretty bad. Lexi\u2019s play was also so unnecessary, like I get that they were trying to show how she was coming out of her shell and stuff, but I feel like they could have done that in a much better way, we as the audience really didn\u2019t need a whole recap of the events of season 1 in a school play that would have never been allowed to exist in a real school. Outside of just the writing though, I mean these people have waited SO LONG to release the next season, it\u2019s gonna be 4 years by the time the new season comes out. I know there were unexpected deaths from the cast which is just a tragedy, but it\u2019s been so long and there\u2019s so many people missing in the show now that I feel like people aren\u2019t even excited about this show anymore, and they should lowkey just call it good, but of course they\u2019re gonna milk it financially for all that it\u2019s worth.

Same story with The Sopranos. Those are 2 of my all time favorite shows. I can't believe this little CW show ended up being so good! I'm on my 3rd re watch now. The acting, writing, creativity, suspense and drama here are all top notch. I was a skeptic and put this show off for years. I thought without the TV-14/MA rating, I wouldn't be interested. Boy was I wrong. I tend to like more \"real world\" shows (Yes, I know I like GOT). I've never seen any Lord of the Rings or any Harry Potter and don't venture in to Sci-Fi often. I thought that was the target audience here. After my first two watch's of The 100, I couldn't stop thinking about it. To me, it's the best non rated R series ever next to Breaking Bad.

I realize it is just me... but.  \n\nI really liked the story arc of Octavia and Indra, but hated the arc of Bellamy.  The way they handled Emori's death was sweet, and I understand that Murphy had to pay some sort of a price for his horrible mistakes.  Clarke's arc seems about right... But I do feel that she did everything for the betterment of her friends and her people... and killing the guy in front of the judge kind of seems forced. \n\n  \nThe ending I do not like.

In other words, will I be able to watch it and enjoy/understand it without first burning through the series from where I am now?\n\nI appreciate the advice while avoiding spoilers from post season 9.   I\u2019m also open to recs of other great later episodes that stand on their own, though given the time restraints I would need to be picky to weed out the lesser stuff from the great ones. \n\nAlso, one last thing; it sucks that Netflix is losing the show.  But there may be a tiny sliver of hope in that it\u2019s been reported that Netflix is privately in communication with the owners of Warner Bros, which is up for sale.   They are interested in purchasing WB, but at this current stage they\u2019re just feeling out their options versus other potential buyers to see if it\u2019s feasible not only for themselves but for WB seller.

There's this episode, Azazel feeding demon blood to six-month old Sam, the woman in white basically force-kissing and abusing Sam in the pilot, Meg possessing Sam in S2E14, Ruby exploiting him with demon blood in season 4, the two hunters literally forcing demon blood down Sam's throat while physically restraining him in S5E3, that whole Becky plot in S7E8, and more.

He went from being a selfish, jealous bully to the best goddamn babysitter on the planet! Ever since he saw the Demogorgon at the Byers house in S1, he has become such a good guy. He is fiercely protective about those he cares about, especially the younger kids, who he often has to help protect as they go through with their VERY dangerous plans to combat the Upside Down.\n\nIn S4, he tells Nancy he's been thinking about what he wants his life to look like after this is all over. He's always dreamed of having a wife and 6 kids, packing them into an RV, and driving around the country to see the Grand Canyon and other great wonders of the world. He later admits to Nancy in the Upside Down that she is the wife he's been dreaming of. He has never fully gotten over her.\n\nWhile Nancy does care about Steve a lot, she has a boyfriend despite their issues and she only sees Steve as a close friend. You can tell by the look on her face she was hoping he wouldn't say that. And not only that, but Steve's dream sounds like a nightmare for someone as driven as Nancy. To have 6 kids at that point in time, Nancy would have to be a stay at home mom. And she seems like someone who would want her own career to feel fulfilled, like becoming a journalist.\n\nSomething many fans don't realize is that Steve's dream has already come true, just not in the way he had thought. He did in fact drive around in an RV with Nancy and 6 kids to prepare to go after Vecna. That sounds like an incredible setup for an absolutely devastating death.\n\nDo you think Steve will die? Will he sacrifice himself to save one of the kids or even Nancy herself? Is Steve dying the reason why Nancy is crying and washing blood off her hands in the S5 trailer? I know most fans would be heartbroken over this and I do not want it to happen, but it seems probable that it could happen.", "timestamp": 1763739181, "label": "ERROR"}

Zero second of fillers and the storyline is just so packed and well paced. \n\nThe show had this perfect balance of mystery, horror, thrill and heart back then. Season 1 feels like lightning in a bottle. Small town, small cast and one central mission, find Will. The world hadn't exploded into ten different storylines yet, the tension stayed insane. \n\nThe scale being small did wonders. One missing kid. One group of boys. One grieving mom. One girl with powers. One shady lab. That\u2019s it. And somehow it felt massive because the stakes were so personal.\n\nNo matter how big the show gets, that first season is always going to feel like lightning in a bottle. It set the tone perfectly. And this is why Season 2 is my 2nd favourite Season, it had the essence of Season 1. \n\nSeason 2 is the closest the show ever got to recapturing that formula. It felt like Hawkins wasn\u2019t drowning in plot threads unlike the later seasons. The characters were dealing with the fallout of Season 1, everyone was still connected, the tone stayed grounded, and Will\u2019s possession arc was just so damn strong.", "timestamp": 1763739181, "label": "ERROR"}

{"original_topic": "wednesday", "comment": "I really wish Tyler and the other Hydes were written more like actual Jekyll-and-Hyde monsters Basically, exactly what the title says. A lot of the writing in this show is\u2026 let\u2019s call it \u201cwonky,\u201d and the show's lore suffers from it. The Alpha werewolf lore feels like it was made up in 5 minutes, and the Hyde lore isn\u2019t much better. The show dedicated two seasons to Hydes, and it still feels all over the place.\n\nHydes are clearly inspired by Robert Louis Stevenson's novella *The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde*. In the novella, Dr. Henry Jekyll develops a potion to separate his good and evil sides. When he drinks it, he transforms into evil Edward Hyde. Over time, Jekyll's transformations become more frequent and involuntary. The novella ends with Jekyll's final, unchangeable transformation into Hyde, who then commits suicide.\u00a0Throughout the story, Jekyll remembers everything he does as Hyde. Hyde is not a separate personality that takes over Jekyll's consciousness; rather, Hyde is Jekyll acting without his usual inhibitions, and Jekyll is fully aware of Hyde's actions. Essentially,\u00a0Jekyll tries to use the transformation to indulge in his darker impulses.\n\nThat\u2019s a very cool concept. And in Season 1, it seemed like the show was going in that direction. Tyler\u2019s first transformations are triggered by Laurel\u2019s chemicals. Maybe not at first, but over time, he becomes fully aware of his actions as a Hyde and starts enjoying them, because they give him the freedom to act on impulses he normally suppresses. That tracks with the original novella. But then the show adds lore that honestly makes everything messier: the **\u201cmaster\u201d**.\n\nAt first, I get it; writers needed a way to justify Laurel controlling Tyler and tie the twist together. Fine. But Season 2 introduces Tyler\u2019s mother, and suddenly the whole \u201cmaster\u201d concept becomes a narrative roadblock. So now apparently female Hydes don\u2019t need a master, only male Hydes do. BUT the master\u2019s control seems optional because Tyler kills Laurel and fights his own mother, AND male Hydes supposedly go \u201cinsane\u201d without a master, AND they still die young because each transformation shortens their lifespan. It really sucks being a male hyena. I mean Hyde.\n\nSo\u2026 what does a \u201cmaster\u201d even mean anymore?\n\nIt just feels *messy.* I wish they had stuck closer to the original Jekyll-and-Hyde idea rather than constantly adding plot-convenient rules that contradict earlier ones. And it\u2019s not just Hydes. The Alpha werewolf lore is equally vague and inconsistent.\n\nSeason 3 is going to expand the Hyde/werewolf lore even more with Capri and her mix of Hydes and werewolves, and honestly? I\u2019m scared that by the end of it, things are going to be even more convoluted than they already are, when they really don\u2019t need to be.\n\nAlso, as I was finishing typing all of this, I remembered that in Season 1, Xavier had some weird psychic connection to Tyler/Hyde, which the show never explained. But I guess we\u2019re never going to learn how or why that worked. Oh well\u2026\n\nJust some of my thoughts. What do you guys think about Hydes and how the show handles their lore?", "timestamp": 1763739181, "label": "ERROR"}

{"original_topic": "wednesday", "comment": "Why Wenclair Doesn\u2019t Click for Me Anymore- as a huge fan of the ship after s1 I\u2019ve been trying really hard to figure out why Wenclair doesn\u2019t hit for me anymore, especially because I *want* to love them the way I did back in season one. I genuinely enjoyed their dynamic at first. Their contrast felt natural, their growth felt earned, and the whole \u201cOpessites attract\u201d trope actually worked really well. They had softness, tension, vulnerability, and all these tiny moments that made their connection feel warm and meaningful. I really believed in the version of them that season one was building.\n\nBut after S1, something changed for me, and it\u2019s been harder than I expected to reconnect with the ship. In season two, the relationship that hooked me just\u2026 wasn\u2019t there in the same way. They spent a lot of their scenes either arguing, miscommunicating, or being emotionally out of sync, and I never felt like the show gave them the time to rebuild or deepen the connection they started with. Even when they *did* have an emotional moment, like right before switching their bodies back, it didn\u2019t carry that same spark or weight from S1. It felt more like a leftover of what they used to be rather than a continuation of what they could\u2019ve become.\n\nI\u2019m not saying the writing was malicious or that the characters stopped caring about each other, but the shift in their dynamic made it harder for me to see the romantic potential that used to stand out so clearly. Instead of growing closer, it felt like they drifted apart, and the emotional thread between them got thinner instead of stronger. And when a ship relies heavily on chemistry, softness, and contrast, that shift really affects how you connect with it.\n\nI also want to be clear: this isn\u2019t an attack on Wenclair or the people who love it. I completely understand why the ship is meaningful to so many fans, and I think the version of Wenclair in season one was genuinely compelling. I\u2019m not trying to take that away from anyone. I\u2019m just being honest about my own experience: after S1, the show didn\u2019t give me the same feeling or energy that originally made me see their relationship in a romantic light.\n\nThe frustrating part is that I *wish* I still shipped it. I wish I could recapture that spark I felt the first time around. I wish I could go back to seeing what everyone else still sees. But the shift in how they were written in S2 changed the way I interpreted their dynamic, and no matter how much I try to get that old feeling back, I can\u2019t force it.\n\nSo this isn\u2019t a hate post, or a dismissal, or some superiority compex thing. It\u2019s just me admitting that the version of Wenclair I connected to isn\u2019t really present anymore, at least not for me. And I really wish that wasn\u2019t the case.", "timestamp": 1763739181, "label": "ERROR"}

{"original_topic": "breaking_bad", "comment": "Daily reminder that neither Mike nor Walt were \"right\" or \"wrong\", they were both pretty terrible people I saw a post yesterday about how Mike was wrong in his argument against Walt about how they had a good thing and Walt blew it up. I actually don't disagree with everything said about Mike's \"points\". I agree with a lot of it. \n\nI think Gus had Tomas murdered or at least knew that's what the dealers would do. Think about it. Gus' big thing is that his people don't operate without his consent or knowledge. Gus liked these dealers so much, he risked his relationship with Walt to protect them. There's no way they did that without Gus having at least mild knowledge of it. I think it was a play to get Jesse killed. Jesse goes to retaliate, believing Walt wouldn't care or react or even know about it until Jesse had already gone to the dealers. They were already waiting for him, Jesse gets gunned down and Gus consoles Walt after having the dealers killed by Mike for killing Tomas and causing the situation to begin with. Now Gus has Walt, his perfect lab and no more \"junkie\". Walt knew this, he figured it out and literally told Gus that hypothetically Jesse might have believed it was Gus' doing. The show writers wouldn't have Walt say this unless they wanted us to think about it. \n\nBut does that make Walt the good guy? Or Mike? No. Mike wanted to kill Jesse for a long time. He wanted to kill Jesse just for doing drugs after his girlfriend died. Literally told Walt, \"Let me take care of it\" intending to kill Jesse at a drug house when he was consumed with grief. The same Mike that we're supposed to believe saw Jesse as a son. \n\nOn the flip side, Mike figured Walt out and knew exactly what kind of man Walt was. Walt isn't a saint. He kept Jesse alive for his own selfish reasons. He used Jesse, manipulated him, took advantage of him. And let's not forget... Walt caused Jane to turn over and choke and then stood there while she choked. Walt is also the reason they got mixed up with Gus to begin with. \n\nHere's the list of garbage moves Walt made that caused Jesse's life to get progressively worse at every turn: \n\n1. When they were making cash hand over fist, Walt freaked out about Skinny Pete getting mugged which is absolutely a thing that dealers have to deal with. This put Jesse in a compromising situation for a wad of cash that they could easily make back on the back end. No retaliation is bad for business? You can retaliate in other ways. Black list those \"customers\" and they'll find a way to pay you back. Like Jesse said, they had the best product and no one else was dealing because Tuco was dead. \n\n2. After Jesse gets caught up in a situation that leads to a man's death, he starts getting cocky and pushes for them to expand. He tries to act like a know it all, pulling out a map and *teaching* Jesse, the one who is in charge of business, new areas to expand to. Jesse literally warns him that going into new territory will lead to violent encounters but Walt is happy to milk the MISBELIEF that Jesse killed Spooge even though he knows Jesse and his crew are no killers. At this point, they don't even have junior dealers working for Badger, Skinny Pete or Combo. \n\n3. Every single thing that Jesse warned Walt about happens. First, Badger gets arrested which costs them $80k to resolve. This also loses them a dealer. And then, disaster: Combo gets killed. Where? In new territory where Gus' dealers are. This means they're down two dealers and only have Skinny Pete. And he naturally wants out because Combo is dead. This also puts Jesse under tremendous stress which leads to him leaning heavily into drugs. Walt starts worrying about how they're going to sell 50 pounds of product, but he doesn't seem AT ALL worried about Jesse. He finagles a deal with a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy and manages to get a deal to sell all of his product to Gus. At this point, there's no doubt that Gus is most likely buying it just to get it off the market. \n\nThe entire reason they end up in business with Gus, the entire reason Combo was killed by Gus' dealers, the entire reason this whole business deal with Gus even starts is due to **WALT'S EGO**. His ego is also what led to them having their run-in with Tuco. Walt was angry about $1500-$2000 a day being too slow for him and wanted to sell to a distributor. Walt was angry about needing pseudo for a traditional cook so he concocted the plan to steal methylamine. Out of everyone, Gus and Walt are the only ones who didn't want to \"get out\" of the business. \n\nMike was a lot of things, and up until he finally warmed up to Jesse, he was a piece of shit in a lot of ways, but he wasn't in the business to be in the business. He was happy to get out ahead at various points in the series. Him and Jesse were willing to walk away, sell their shares of the methylamine and walk away with more money than they could've earned in a lifetime. But who wanted to stay? Walt. \n\nIt's easy to see Walt as the reasonable one who wanted to help Jesse. But it's important to understand that almost every time Walt \"saved\" Jesse, he was saving Jesse from a horrible situation that **he himself** put Jesse in.", "timestamp": 1763740018, "label": "0"}

In other words, will I be able to watch it and enjoy/understand it without first burning through the series from where I am now?\n\nI appreciate the advice while avoiding spoilers from post season 9.   I\u2019m also open to recs of other great later episodes that stand on their own, though given the time restraints I would need to be picky to weed out the lesser stuff from the great ones. \n\nAlso, one last thing; it sucks that Netflix is losing the show.  But there may be a tiny sliver of hope in that it\u2019s been reported that Netflix is privately in communication with the owners of Warner Bros, which is up for sale.   They are interested in purchasing WB, but at this current stage they\u2019re just feeling out their options versus other potential buyers to see if it\u2019s feasible not only for themselves but for WB seller.  And of course, if they can purchase WB they would be outright getting the rights for Supernatural amongst their entire vast catalogue.  It probably won\u2019t happen soon, but it could still happen.  Something to keep an eye on.\n\nI appreciate any comments about the two episodes referenced, cheers.  \u270c\ufe0f", "timestamp": 1763740019, "label": "0"}

This is season 5 episode 12 \"Swap Meat\" where this teenage boy basically used his abilities to switch bodies with Sam. I get this was supposed to be some unusual thing they haven't really experienced before, but the amount of times throughout this show when Sam's own body gets taken advantage of or violated is very unsettling. There's this episode, Azazel feeding demon blood to six-month old Sam, the woman in white basically force-kissing and abusing Sam in the pilot, Meg possessing Sam in S2E14, Ruby exploiting him with demon blood in season 4, the two hunters literally forcing demon blood down Sam's throat while physically restraining him in S5E3, that whole Becky plot in S7E8, and more. Why did the writers have Sam being constantly violated and taken advantage of and being the bigger punching bag and using them for laughs and humor?

That wasn\u2019t his decision. Yet he gets blamed for it for seasons, as if he had any control over what was done to him.\n\nWhen he killed Lilith, everyone treated it like the right move\u2026 until the fallout came, and suddenly it was all on him again.\n\nThen he literally throws himself into the Cage to stop Lucifer. He saves the world in the most brutal way possible. But instead of people acknowledging that sacrifice, the focus becomes how \u201csoulless\u201d he was afterward, like that was some moral failing on his part.\n\nSeason 10 hits it even harder. Sam does everything he can to save Dean from the Mark and from being a demon. He stretches himself thin emotionally and physically, and he never once attacks Dean the way Dean attacks him. And in the finale, when Dean is ready to kill him because Death told him to, Sam accepts it. He\u2019s still loving, still gentle, still trying to reach his brother.\n\nFor a character who\u2019s constantly sacrificing himself, it\u2019s wild how rarely he gets real credit for it.", "timestamp": 1763740019, "label": "0"}

It seemed that things fell apart for me once they left Earth.  I realize that there may have been delays in production and cast changes, but it seemed like a huge departure from the overall plot.  I realize it is just me... but.  \n\nI really liked the story arc of Octavia and Indra, but hated the arc of Bellamy.  The way they handled Emori's death was sweet, and I understand that Murphy had to pay some sort of a price for his horrible mistakes.  Clarke's arc seems about right... But I do feel that she did everything for the betterment of her friends and her people... and killing the guy in front of the judge kind of seems forced. \n\n  \nThe ending I do not like.  I do like that her core people come back to be with her... but I don't like that they are ostracized and they can't repopulate.

{"original_topic": "wednesday", "comment": "I really wish Tyler and the other Hydes were written more like actual Jekyll-and-Hyde monsters Basically, exactly what the title says. A lot of the writing in this show is\u2026 let\u2019s call it \u201cwonky,\u201d and the show's lore suffers from it. The Alpha werewolf lore feels like it was made up in 5 minutes, and the Hyde lore isn\u2019t much better. The show dedicated two seasons to Hydes, and it still feels all over the place.\n\nHydes are clearly inspired by Robert Louis Stevenson's novella *The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde*. In the novella, Dr. Henry Jekyll develops a potion to separate his good and evil sides. When he drinks it, he transforms into evil Edward Hyde. Over time, Jekyll's transformations become more frequent and involuntary. The novella ends with Jekyll's final, unchangeable transformation into Hyde, who then commits suicide.\u00a0Throughout the story, Jekyll remembers everything he does as Hyde. Hyde is not a separate personality that takes over Jekyll's consciousness; rather, Hyde is Jekyll acting without his usual inhibitions, and Jekyll is fully aware of Hyde's actions. Essentially,\u00a0Jekyll tries to use the transformation to indulge in his darker impulses.\n\nThat\u2019s a very cool concept. And in Season 1, it seemed like the show was going in that direction. Tyler\u2019s first transformations are triggered by Laurel\u2019s chemicals. Maybe not at first, but over time, he becomes fully aware of his actions as a Hyde and starts enjoying them, because they give him the freedom to act on impulses he normally suppresses. That tracks with the original novella. But then the show adds lore that honestly makes everything messier: the **\u201cmaster\u201d**.\n\nAt first, I get it; writers needed a way to justify Laurel controlling Tyler and tie the twist together. Fine. But Season 2 introduces Tyler\u2019s mother, and suddenly the whole \u201cmaster\u201d concept becomes a narrative roadblock. So now apparently female Hydes don\u2019t need a master, only male Hydes do. BUT the master\u2019s control seems optional because Tyler kills Laurel and fights his own mother, AND male Hydes supposedly go \u201cinsane\u201d without a master, AND they still die young because each transformation shortens their lifespan. It really sucks being a male hyena. I mean Hyde.\n\nSo\u2026 what does a \u201cmaster\u201d even mean anymore?\n\nIt just feels *messy.* I wish they had stuck closer to the original Jekyll-and-Hyde idea rather than constantly adding plot-convenient rules that contradict earlier ones. And it\u2019s not just Hydes. The Alpha werewolf lore is equally vague and inconsistent.\n\nSeason 3 is going to expand the Hyde/werewolf lore even more with Capri and her mix of Hydes and werewolves, and honestly? I\u2019m scared that by the end of it, things are going to be even more convoluted than they already are, when they really don\u2019t need to be.\n\nAlso, as I was finishing typing all of this, I remembered that in Season 1, Xavier had some weird psychic connection to Tyler/Hyde, which the show never explained. But I guess we\u2019re never going to learn how or why that worked. Oh well\u2026\n\nJust some of my thoughts. What do you guys think about Hydes and how the show handles their lore?", "timestamp": 1763740020, "label": "1"}

{"original_topic": "wednesday", "comment": "Why Wenclair Doesn\u2019t Click for Me Anymore- as a huge fan of the ship after s1 I\u2019ve been trying really hard to figure out why Wenclair doesn\u2019t hit for me anymore, especially because I *want* to love them the way I did back in season one. I genuinely enjoyed their dynamic at first. Their contrast felt natural, their growth felt earned, and the whole \u201cOpessites attract\u201d trope actually worked really well. They had softness, tension, vulnerability, and all these tiny moments that made their connection feel warm and meaningful. I really believed in the version of them that season one was building.\n\nBut after S1, something changed for me, and it\u2019s been harder than I expected to reconnect with the ship. In season two, the relationship that hooked me just\u2026 wasn\u2019t there in the same way. They spent a lot of their scenes either arguing, miscommunicating, or being emotionally out of sync, and I never felt like the show gave them the time to rebuild or deepen the connection they started with. Even when they *did* have an emotional moment, like right before switching their bodies back, it didn\u2019t carry that same spark or weight from S1. It felt more like a leftover of what they used to be rather than a continuation of what they could\u2019ve become.\n\nI\u2019m not saying the writing was malicious or that the characters stopped caring about each other, but the shift in their dynamic made it harder for me to see the romantic potential that used to stand out so clearly. Instead of growing closer, it felt like they drifted apart, and the emotional thread between them got thinner instead of stronger. And when a ship relies heavily on chemistry, softness, and contrast, that shift really affects how you connect with it.\n\nI also want to be clear: this isn\u2019t an attack on Wenclair or the people who love it. I completely understand why the ship is meaningful to so many fans, and I think the version of Wenclair in season one was genuinely compelling. I\u2019m not trying to take that away from anyone. I\u2019m just being honest about my own experience: after S1, the show didn\u2019t give me the same feeling or energy that originally made me see their relationship in a romantic light.\n\nThe frustrating part is that I *wish* I still shipped it. I wish I could recapture that spark I felt the first time around. I wish I could go back to seeing what everyone else still sees. But the shift in how they were written in S2 changed the way I interpreted their dynamic, and no matter how much I try to get that old feeling back, I can\u2019t force it.\n\nSo this isn\u2019t a hate post, or a dismissal, or some superiority compex thing. It\u2019s just me admitting that the version of Wenclair I connected to isn\u2019t really present anymore, at least not for me. And I really wish that wasn\u2019t the case.", "timestamp": 1763740020, "label": "1"}

For a while now, I\u2019ve noticed that a boy in my class behaves in a certain way towards me, and I\u2019m not sure how to interpret it. Here are the facts:\n\n1. **At the beginning of the school year**, he often tried to make eye contact with me. I\u2019m very shy, so I avoided it. Then, he started calling me *Baka* (a Japanese word for \"idiot\") discreetly, but I could clearly hear him.\n2. **As time went on, his behavior changed**. During a school trip, on the bus, he suddenly said: *\"Wesh \\[my name\\], how are you!?\"* Then, he kept looking at me. Every time I looked at him, he would look away, and when I turned back to the window, he would look at me again. This went on for a while until I got too embarrassed and turned completely away.\n3. **One day in class**, I was talking to his little sister (we\u2019ve become friends) a bit away from the group. When we decided to rejoin the others, he suddenly rushed towards my friend, stopped abruptly when he saw me, and then went back to his friends.\n4. **His little sister told me things about him**. She said he talked about me at home, saying that at the beginning of the year, he had certain thoughts about me, but now it\u2019s better. He also said that I was nice and that I didn\u2019t talk to boys, which made me a \"good Muslim.\" He asked her not to tell me, but of course, she did.\n5. **One day, he asked if I was Moroccan**. I replied a bit curtly (I regret it). My friend later told me that before I arrived, he was talking to his friend about wanting to focus on his projects, but as soon as I walked in, he asked me that question.\n6. **Recently, while I was handing out papers in class**, he suddenly turned towards me and whispered something to his friend.\n7. **Another time, he asked me:** *\"Are you going to defend me at the class council?\"* (I\u2019m just an eco-delegate and not involved in the class council). Right after asking, he left without waiting for an answer.\n\nI\u2019m confused. He seems comfortable talking to other girls, but with me, he acts distant and ambiguous. Do you think he might be interested in me, or am I reading too much into this? How should I react?\n\nThank you in advance for your advice!\n\nAsk me questions if some points are not clear :)", "timestamp": 1763740021, "label": "0"}

{"original_topic": "euphoria", "comment": "Euphoria really destroyed its potential Hey y\u2019all, so I was bored and decided to rewatch Euphoria, and dang guys season 1 is literally so peak. I really feel like Euphoria stands out from all these other high school dramas because the aesthetic and cinematography is just beautiful, not to mention that I also feel like the characters are super realistic (not so much the whole high school aspect because every one of these bitches would be dress coded in two seconds if it was the real world lol) but just the way the characters think and feel, I mean I\u2019m in college now but when season 1 first came out, I was a sophomore in high school and the characters were just so relatable to me.\n\nBut I\u2019m not gonna lie, Euphoria really just wasted away all of its potential with season 2 and how they\u2019re treating the release of season 3. First of all, season 2 was lowkey trash. There wasn\u2019t much in the way of character development or just overall storyline, and after rewatching season 2, it really just feels kind of dragged on. When the hype was going on for season 2, people treated this show like it could do no wrong and so did I, but now I really just feel like season 2 is pretty bad. Lexi\u2019s play was also so unnecessary, like I get that they were trying to show how she was coming out of her shell and stuff, but I feel like they could have done that in a much better way, we as the audience really didn\u2019t need a whole recap of the events of season 1 in a school play that would have never been allowed to exist in a real school. Outside of just the writing though, I mean these people have waited SO LONG to release the next season, it\u2019s gonna be 4 years by the time the new season comes out. I know there were unexpected deaths from the cast which is just a tragedy, but it\u2019s been so long and there\u2019s so many people missing in the show now that I feel like people aren\u2019t even excited about this show anymore, and they should lowkey just call it good, but of course they\u2019re gonna milk it financially for all that it\u2019s worth.

He went from being a selfish, jealous bully to the best goddamn babysitter on the planet! Ever since he saw the Demogorgon at the Byers house in S1, he has become such a good guy. He is fiercely protective about those he cares about, especially the younger kids, who he often has to help protect as they go through with their VERY dangerous plans to combat the Upside Down.\n\nIn S4, he tells Nancy he's been thinking about what he wants his life to look like after this is all over. He's always dreamed of having a wife and 6 kids, packing them into an RV, and driving around the country to see the Grand Canyon and other great wonders of the world. He later admits to Nancy in the Upside Down that she is the wife he's been dreaming of. He has never fully gotten over her.\n\nWhile Nancy does care about Steve a lot, she has a boyfriend despite their issues and she only sees Steve as a close friend. You can tell by the look on her face she was hoping he wouldn't say that. And not only that, but Steve's dream sounds like a nightmare for someone as driven as Nancy. To have 6 kids at that point in time, Nancy would have to be a stay at home mom. And she seems like someone who would want her own career to feel fulfilled, like becoming a journalist.\n\nSomething many fans don't realize is that Steve's dream has already come true, just not in the way he had thought. He did in fact drive around in an RV with Nancy and 6 kids to prepare to go after Vecna. That sounds like an incredible setup for an absolutely devastating death.\n\nDo you think Steve will die? Will he sacrifice himself to save one of the kids or even Nancy herself? Is Steve dying the reason why Nancy is crying and washing blood off her hands in the S5 trailer?

{"original_topic": "stranger_things", "comment": "It's funny how two of the best (if not THE best) acting performances over a single season of Stranger Things came from actors whose characters were flayed Noah Schnapp in season 2 and Dacre Montgomery in season 3.\n\nNoah really sold Will's trauma and the slow reveal of him being revealed to be possessed. It was so real and intense the entire time and that exorcism scene was terrifying.\n\nDacre was great as both versions of Billy, normal villain and flayed villain, but he really sold it in season 3 especially with the speech to El which I will say is arguably better than the one by 001 in the lab, not in terms of what it reveals or overall epicness but the raw emotion behind it. \n\nIdk it's not that important just a little thing I noticed", "timestamp": 1763740022, "label": "1"}

For a while now, I\u2019ve noticed that a boy in my class behaves in a certain way towards me, and I\u2019m not sure how to interpret it. Here are the facts:\n\n1. **At the beginning of the school year**, he often tried to make eye contact with me. I\u2019m very shy, so I avoided it. Then, he started calling me *Baka* (a Japanese word for \"idiot\") discreetly, but I could clearly hear him.\n2. **As time went on, his behavior changed**. During a school trip, on the bus, he suddenly said: *\"Wesh \\[my name\\], how are you!?\"* Then, he kept looking at me. Every time I looked at him, he would look away, and when I turned back to the window, he would look at me again. This went on for a while until I got too embarrassed and turned completely away.\n3. **One day in class**, I was talking to his little sister (we\u2019ve become friends) a bit away from the group. When we decided to rejoin the others, he suddenly rushed towards my friend, stopped abruptly when he saw me, and then went back to his friends.\n4. **His little sister told me things about him**. She said he talked about me at home, saying that at the beginning of the year, he had certain thoughts about me, but now it\u2019s better. He also said that I was nice and that I didn\u2019t talk to boys, which made me a \"good Muslim.\" He asked her not to tell me, but of course, she did.\n5. **One day, he asked if I was Moroccan**. I replied a bit curtly (I regret it). My friend later told me that before I arrived, he was talking to his friend about wanting to focus on his projects, but as soon as I walked in, he asked me that question.\n6. **Recently, while I was handing out papers in class**, he suddenly turned towards me and whispered something to his friend.\n7. **Another time, he asked me:** *\"Are you going to defend me at the class council?\"* (I\u2019m just an eco-delegate and not involved in the class council). Right after asking, he left without waiting for an answer.\n\nI\u2019m confused. He seems comfortable talking to other girls, but with me, he acts distant and ambiguous. Do you think he might be interested in me, or am I reading too much into this? How should I react?\n\nThank you in advance for your advice!\n\nAsk me questions if some points are not clear :)", "timestamp": 1763741746, "label": "0"}

Season 1 feels like lightning in a bottle. Small town, small cast and one central mission, find Will.

And somehow it felt massive because the stakes were so personal.\n\nNo matter how big the show gets, that first season is always going to feel like lightning in a bottle. It set the tone perfectly. And this is why Season 2 is my 2nd favourite Season, it had the essence of Season 1. \n\nSeason 2 is the closest the show ever got to recapturing that formula.

{"original_topic": "wednesday", "comment": "I really wish Tyler and the other Hydes were written more like actual Jekyll-and-Hyde monsters Basically, exactly what the title says. A lot of the writing in this show is\u2026 let\u2019s call it \u201cwonky,\u201d and the show's lore suffers from it. The Alpha werewolf lore feels like it was made up in 5 minutes, and the Hyde lore isn\u2019t much better. The show dedicated two seasons to Hydes, and it still feels all over the place.\n\nHydes are clearly inspired by Robert Louis Stevenson's novella *The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde*. In the novella, Dr. Henry Jekyll develops a potion to separate his good and evil sides. When he drinks it, he transforms into evil Edward Hyde. Over time, Jekyll's transformations become more frequent and involuntary. The novella ends with Jekyll's final, unchangeable transformation into Hyde, who then commits suicide.\u00a0Throughout the story, Jekyll remembers everything he does as Hyde. Hyde is not a separate personality that takes over Jekyll's consciousness; rather, Hyde is Jekyll acting without his usual inhibitions, and Jekyll is fully aware of Hyde's actions. Essentially,\u00a0Jekyll tries to use the transformation to indulge in his darker impulses.\n\nThat\u2019s a very cool concept. And in Season 1, it seemed like the show was going in that direction. Tyler\u2019s first transformations are triggered by Laurel\u2019s chemicals. Maybe not at first, but over time, he becomes fully aware of his actions as a Hyde and starts enjoying them, because they give him the freedom to act on impulses he normally suppresses. That tracks with the original novella. But then the show adds lore that honestly makes everything messier: the **\u201cmaster\u201d**.\n\nAt first, I get it; writers needed a way to justify Laurel controlling Tyler and tie the twist together. Fine. But Season 2 introduces Tyler\u2019s mother, and suddenly the whole \u201cmaster\u201d concept becomes a narrative roadblock. So now apparently female Hydes don\u2019t need a master, only male Hydes do. BUT the master\u2019s control seems optional because Tyler kills Laurel and fights his own mother, AND male Hydes supposedly go \u201cinsane\u201d without a master, AND they still die young because each transformation shortens their lifespan. It really sucks being a male hyena. I mean Hyde.\n\nSo\u2026 what does a \u201cmaster\u201d even mean anymore?\n\nIt just feels *messy.* I wish they had stuck closer to the original Jekyll-and-Hyde idea rather than constantly adding plot-convenient rules that contradict earlier ones. And it\u2019s not just Hydes. The Alpha werewolf lore is equally vague and inconsistent.\n\nSeason 3 is going to expand the Hyde/werewolf lore even more with Capri and her mix of Hydes and werewolves, and honestly? I\u2019m scared that by the end of it, things are going to be even more convoluted than they already are, when they really don\u2019t need to be.\n\nAlso, as I was finishing typing all of this, I remembered that in Season 1, Xavier had some weird psychic connection to Tyler/Hyde, which the show never explained. But I guess we\u2019re never going to learn how or why that worked. Oh well\u2026\n\nJust some of my thoughts. What do you guys think about Hydes and how the show handles their lore?", "timestamp": 1763743006, "label": "1"}

{"original_topic": "wednesday", "comment": "Why Wenclair Doesn\u2019t Click for Me Anymore- as a huge fan of the ship after s1 I\u2019ve been trying really hard to figure out why Wenclair doesn\u2019t hit for me anymore, especially because I *want* to love them the way I did back in season one. I genuinely enjoyed their dynamic at first. Their contrast felt natural, their growth felt earned, and the whole \u201cOpessites attract\u201d trope actually worked really well. They had softness, tension, vulnerability, and all these tiny moments that made their connection feel warm and meaningful. I really believed in the version of them that season one was building.\n\nBut after S1, something changed for me, and it\u2019s been harder than I expected to reconnect with the ship. In season two, the relationship that hooked me just\u2026 wasn\u2019t there in the same way. They spent a lot of their scenes either arguing, miscommunicating, or being emotionally out of sync, and I never felt like the show gave them the time to rebuild or deepen the connection they started with. Even when they *did* have an emotional moment, like right before switching their bodies back, it didn\u2019t carry that same spark or weight from S1. It felt more like a leftover of what they used to be rather than a continuation of what they could\u2019ve become.\n\nI\u2019m not saying the writing was malicious or that the characters stopped caring about each other, but the shift in their dynamic made it harder for me to see the romantic potential that used to stand out so clearly. Instead of growing closer, it felt like they drifted apart, and the emotional thread between them got thinner instead of stronger. And when a ship relies heavily on chemistry, softness, and contrast, that shift really affects how you connect with it.\n\nI also want to be clear: this isn\u2019t an attack on Wenclair or the people who love it. I completely understand why the ship is meaningful to so many fans, and I think the version of Wenclair in season one was genuinely compelling. I\u2019m not trying to take that away from anyone. I\u2019m just being honest about my own experience: after S1, the show didn\u2019t give me the same feeling or energy that originally made me see their relationship in a romantic light.\n\nThe frustrating part is that I *wish* I still shipped it. I wish I could recapture that spark I felt the first time around. I wish I could go back to seeing what everyone else still sees. But the shift in how they were written in S2 changed the way I interpreted their dynamic, and no matter how much I try to get that old feeling back, I can\u2019t force it.\n\nSo this isn\u2019t a hate post, or a dismissal, or some superiority compex thing. It\u2019s just me admitting that the version of Wenclair I connected to isn\u2019t really present anymore, at least not for me.

{"original_topic": "wednesday", "comment": "A Thought An idea, probably original, perhaps not, but how interesting a Telltale video game (if they hadn't gone bankrupt) based on Wednesday (the Netflix series) would have been. Her story is perfect for the Telltale style, in my opinion, as it shows Wednesday's gradual development. For now, I will limit myself to proposing only the first season.\nConcept:\nI would propose the typical Telltale style, so a point-and-click, but slightly less clunky and limited only to the investigation parts.\nPuzzles: In the investigative sections, an alternating use of powers and the investigation itself (maybe a bit more like Life is Strange). The puzzles will be of medium difficulty and, if solved, will advance the investigation.\nChoices: Clearly, in terms of interactions, there will be choices like any good Telltale game. They can be divided into good and bad choices. However, only certain choices will truly matter (for example, trusting Xavier or not).\nPlot: The plot will not be greatly distorted, but some things will change, and we will see soon.\nGameplay: Gameplay will only involve Wednesday, who will be the only playable character, while the rest will not be. What matters, as already mentioned, are the choices and the approach Wednesday has towards the investigations and her relationships with the various characters. In particular, the most important ones are: Enid, Xavier, Tyler, Thing, and Eugene. In addition to two other important factors: the family's opinion (Gomez, Morticia, Pugsley) and the academy's opinion (how the teachers see you).\nBased on the choices you make, you can have three different endings:\n1. Good Ending: Here, our Wednesday will act more with her heart than her head. That is, she will maintain a solid and lasting friendship with Enid. She will always trust Xavier, avoiding putting him in a bad light and preventing his arrest for being the Hyde. She will always support Eugene and help him gain more self-confidence. In terms of events, the final part will always be the same: Tyler betrays Wednesday, imprisons her, Crackstone awakens, and so on. What changes is who lives and who dies in the end. In the good ending, only Crackstone dies, while both Gates and Tyler are spared. In the end, everything is resolved, and the situation returns to normal. If you chose to trust Xavier, he will not leave but will remain at Nevermore, giving Wednesday the cell phone we saw him give towards the end of the TV season. In general, the family will have a positive opinion of our Wednesday, except Morticia, who will slightly criticize the sentimentality Wednesday acquired during this path. At a school level, the reputation will be at its maximum. Clearly, to obtain this ending, it will be necessary to have Enid at maximum trust (always acting kindly towards her). Clearly, all in pure Addams style.\n2. Neutral Ending: Identical to the first television season. It is obtained by acting neutrally on all fronts, except those impossible to modify. Crackstone dies, both other two villains live. In general, the relationship with Enid will be stable; Xavier will remain confident but will leave the school after having given the cell phone to Wednesday anyway. Here too, both other two aspects (family and school) will both be positive.\n3. Bad Ending: This is obtained only by making bad and generally wrong choices. In the end, all three villains will die. And in general, relationships will be negative, except for Enid, who will still remain by our side, albeit with less trust.\nOpinion Meter: Also important will be the Opinion\u2014the opinion Wednesday herself will have of herself and others. In general, the higher the opinion, the greater the possibility of having the good ending. If it is lower, the negative ending is more likely to be triggered.\nIn addition to the ending, there are also three different possible titles:\n\u2022 Hero: Obtainable only with the positive ending and always performing good deeds.\n\u2022 Savior: Obtainable with the default neutral ending OR can be obtained with the good ending but only if some events are failed or minor choices are missed.\n\u2022 Vigilante: Obtainable only with the bad ending.\nThe episodes will be eight, exactly like the television ones.\nI hope you like it, and if you have any suggestions, feel free to tell me.", "timestamp": 1763743056, "label": "1"}

So this time we\u2019re going to focus mainly on the staging and\u2026 the symbolism of course\u2026 Yes yes I know it\u2019s totally me, can\u2019t change that \ud83d\ude09 Anyway let\u2019s analyze the first image. We see a checkered floor, a circular light like the clock\u2019s hour markings and Isaac in the center getting a literal open-heart surgery to save his life.\n\nThen we go straight to the second image and there\u2026 if you don\u2019t see the connection, honestly you\u2019re not even trying \ud83d\ude09 Fine I\u2019ll explain for those who don\u2019t get it: we have the checkered floor (look at the third photo you can see it better with the red paint), a circular light like a clock and\u2026 yes you saw it\u2026 Tyler and Wednesday in the middle of the light....in the middle of a story\u2026 of the heart? I mean, please don\u2019t throw rocks at me it\u2019s not even me saying it it\u2019s the showrunners themselves ;) Anyway let\u2019s continue.\n\nIt\u2019s kinda crazy that it\u2019s the exact same structure twice right? And what are the symbolics linked to that? I\u2019ve already talked about it in my previous posts and so have other amazing contributors: chess (yes\u2026 again!) and the circular time\u2026 like the endless loop, the story repeating again\u2026\n\nAnd why did I think about the \u201cheart\u201d thing? Well I also remembered the very first scene Tyler and Wednesday have together. She repairs the coffee machine and she diagnoses a valve problem\u2026 yes a valve\u2026 you know just like heart valves\u2026 If I haven\u2019t convinced you well too bad I don\u2019t care. I like monologuing anyway.\n\nBut here comes my theory part which is actually always the same (sorry\u2026 well not really \ud83d\ude09): we\u2019re in a fu\\*\\*ing chess game that\u2019s been going on for at least two generations and honestly I think way more\u2026 And the Hydes are right at the center of the\u2026 thing?\u2026I mean Isaac wasn\u2019t a Hyde but his sister was and that was basically the fight of his whole life\u2026\n\nSo my prediction?  The Hydes are the pawns in a chess game but not just any pawns, in a way they are wanted, kept, controlled\u2026 right in the center of the game\u2026And at some point they are going to have to save Tyler like literally\u2026 from death\u2026 and break the cycle that keeps replaying forever\u2026 But who could take on that role? Who? WHO?? Come on you have it on the tip of your tongue\u2026 We\u2026 We\u2026 Wednesday of course!\n\nSo? Your thoughts, your theories, your comments?

{"original_topic": "adolescence", "comment": "Need advice about a boy at my school Hi,\n\nI\u2019m a 14-year-old girl, and I\u2019m new at my school. For a while now, I\u2019ve noticed that a boy in my class behaves in a certain way towards me, and I\u2019m not sure how to interpret it. Here are the facts:\n\n1. **At the beginning of the school year**, he often tried to make eye contact with me. I\u2019m very shy, so I avoided it. Then, he started calling me *Baka* (a Japanese word for \"idiot\") discreetly, but I could clearly hear him.\n2. **As time went on, his behavior changed**. During a school trip, on the bus, he suddenly said: *\"Wesh \\[my name\\], how are you!?\"* Then, he kept looking at me. Every time I looked at him, he would look away, and when I turned back to the window, he would look at me again. This went on for a while until I got too embarrassed and turned completely away.\n3. **One day in class**, I was talking to his little sister (we\u2019ve become friends) a bit away from the group. When we decided to rejoin the others, he suddenly rushed towards my friend, stopped abruptly when he saw me, and then went back to his friends.\n4. **His little sister told me things about him**. She said he talked about me at home, saying that at the beginning of the year, he had certain thoughts about me, but now it\u2019s better. He also said that I was nice and that I didn\u2019t talk to boys, which made me a \"good Muslim.\" He asked her not to tell me, but of course, she did.\n5. **One day, he asked if I was Moroccan**. I replied a bit curtly (I regret it). My friend later told me that before I arrived, he was talking to his friend about wanting to focus on his projects, but as soon as I walked in, he asked me that question.\n6. **Recently, while I was handing out papers in class**, he suddenly turned towards me and whispered something to his friend.\n7. **Another time, he asked me:** *\"Are you going to defend me at the class council?\"* (I\u2019m just an eco-delegate and not involved in the class council). Right after asking, he left without waiting for an answer.\n\nI\u2019m confused. He seems comfortable talking to other girls, but with me, he acts distant and ambiguous. Do you think he might be interested in me, or am I reading too much into this? How should I react?\n\nThank you in advance for your advice!\n\nAsk me questions if some points are not clear :)", "timestamp": 1763744362, "label": "0"}

I really feel like Euphoria stands out from all these other high school dramas because the aesthetic and cinematography is just beautiful, not to mention that I also feel like the characters are super realistic (not so much the whole high school aspect because every one of these bitches would be dress coded in two seconds if it was the real world lol) but just the way the characters think and feel, I mean I\u2019m in college now but when season 1 first came out, I was a sophomore in high school and the characters were just so relatable to me.\n\nBut I\u2019m not gonna lie, Euphoria really just wasted away all of its potential with season 2 and how they\u2019re treating the release of season 3. First of all, season 2 was lowkey trash. There wasn\u2019t much in the way of character development or just overall storyline, and after rewatching season 2, it really just feels kind of dragged on. When the hype was going on for season 2, people treated this show like it could do no wrong and so did I, but now I really just feel like season 2 is pretty bad. Lexi\u2019s play was also so unnecessary, like I get that they were trying to show how she was coming out of her shell and stuff, but I feel like they could have done that in a much better way, we as the audience really didn\u2019t need a whole recap of the events of season 1 in a school play that would have never been allowed to exist in a real school. Outside of just the writing though, I mean these people have waited SO LONG to release the next season, it\u2019s gonna be 4 years by the time the new season comes out. I know there were unexpected deaths from the cast which is just a tragedy, but it\u2019s been so long and there\u2019s so many people missing in the show now that I feel like people aren\u2019t even excited about this show anymore, and they should lowkey just call it good, but of course they\u2019re gonna milk it financially for all that it\u2019s worth. It just kind of sucks because season 1 had the potential to make the show the best modern teen drama ever made, yet it failed so miserably.", "timestamp": 1763744953, "label": "0"}

I\u2019m also open to recs of other great later episodes that stand on their own, though given the time restraints I would need to be picky to weed out the lesser stuff from the great ones. \n\nAlso, one last thing; it sucks that Netflix is losing the show.  But there may be a tiny sliver of hope in that it\u2019s been reported that Netflix is privately in communication with the owners of Warner Bros, which is up for sale.   They are interested in purchasing WB, but at this current stage they\u2019re just feeling out their options versus other potential buyers to see if it\u2019s feasible not only for themselves but for WB seller.

There's this episode, Azazel feeding demon blood to six-month old Sam, the woman in white basically force-kissing and abusing Sam in the pilot, Meg possessing Sam in S2E14, Ruby exploiting him with demon blood in season 4, the two hunters literally forcing demon blood down Sam's throat while physically restraining him in S5E3, that whole Becky plot in S7E8, and more.

{"original_topic": "breaking_bad", "comment": "Daily reminder that neither Mike nor Walt were \"right\" or \"wrong\", they were both pretty terrible people I saw a post yesterday about how Mike was wrong in his argument against Walt about how they had a good thing and Walt blew it up. I actually don't disagree with everything said about Mike's \"points\". I agree with a lot of it. \n\nI think Gus had Tomas murdered or at least knew that's what the dealers would do. Think about it. Gus' big thing is that his people don't operate without his consent or knowledge. Gus liked these dealers so much, he risked his relationship with Walt to protect them. There's no way they did that without Gus having at least mild knowledge of it. I think it was a play to get Jesse killed. Jesse goes to retaliate, believing Walt wouldn't care or react or even know about it until Jesse had already gone to the dealers. They were already waiting for him, Jesse gets gunned down and Gus consoles Walt after having the dealers killed by Mike for killing Tomas and causing the situation to begin with. Now Gus has Walt, his perfect lab and no more \"junkie\". Walt knew this, he figured it out and literally told Gus that hypothetically Jesse might have believed it was Gus' doing. The show writers wouldn't have Walt say this unless they wanted us to think about it. \n\nBut does that make Walt the good guy? Or Mike? No. Mike wanted to kill Jesse for a long time. He wanted to kill Jesse just for doing drugs after his girlfriend died. Literally told Walt, \"Let me take care of it\" intending to kill Jesse at a drug house when he was consumed with grief. The same Mike that we're supposed to believe saw Jesse as a son. \n\nOn the flip side, Mike figured Walt out and knew exactly what kind of man Walt was. Walt isn't a saint. He kept Jesse alive for his own selfish reasons. He used Jesse, manipulated him, took advantage of him. And let's not forget... Walt caused Jane to turn over and choke and then stood there while she choked. Walt is also the reason they got mixed up with Gus to begin with. \n\nHere's the list of garbage moves Walt made that caused Jesse's life to get progressively worse at every turn: \n\n1. When they were making cash hand over fist, Walt freaked out about Skinny Pete getting mugged which is absolutely a thing that dealers have to deal with. This put Jesse in a compromising situation for a wad of cash that they could easily make back on the back end. No retaliation is bad for business? You can retaliate in other ways. Black list those \"customers\" and they'll find a way to pay you back. Like Jesse said, they had the best product and no one else was dealing because Tuco was dead. \n\n2. After Jesse gets caught up in a situation that leads to a man's death, he starts getting cocky and pushes for them to expand. He tries to act like a know it all, pulling out a map and *teaching* Jesse, the one who is in charge of business, new areas to expand to. Jesse literally warns him that going into new territory will lead to violent encounters but Walt is happy to milk the MISBELIEF that Jesse killed Spooge even though he knows Jesse and his crew are no killers. At this point, they don't even have junior dealers working for Badger, Skinny Pete or Combo. \n\n3. Every single thing that Jesse warned Walt about happens. First, Badger gets arrested which costs them $80k to resolve. This also loses them a dealer. And then, disaster: Combo gets killed. Where? In new territory where Gus' dealers are. This means they're down two dealers and only have Skinny Pete. And he naturally wants out because Combo is dead. This also puts Jesse under tremendous stress which leads to him leaning heavily into drugs. Walt starts worrying about how they're going to sell 50 pounds of product, but he doesn't seem AT ALL worried about Jesse. He finagles a deal with a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy and manages to get a deal to sell all of his product to Gus. At this point, there's no doubt that Gus is most likely buying it just to get it off the market. \n\nThe entire reason they end up in business with Gus, the entire reason Combo was killed by Gus' dealers, the entire reason this whole business deal with Gus even starts is due to **WALT'S EGO**. His ego is also what led to them having their run-in with Tuco. Walt was angry about $1500-$2000 a day being too slow for him and wanted to sell to a distributor. Walt was angry about needing pseudo for a traditional cook so he concocted the plan to steal methylamine. Out of everyone, Gus and Walt are the only ones who didn't want to \"get out\" of the business. \n\nMike was a lot of things, and up until he finally warmed up to Jesse, he was a piece of shit in a lot of ways, but he wasn't in the business to be in the business. He was happy to get out ahead at various points in the series. Him and Jesse were willing to walk away, sell their shares of the methylamine and walk away with more money than they could've earned in a lifetime. But who wanted to stay? Walt. \n\nIt's easy to see Walt as the reasonable one who wanted to help Jesse. But it's important to understand that almost every time Walt \"saved\" Jesse, he was saving Jesse from a horrible situation that **he himself** put Jesse in.", "timestamp": 1763745181, "label": "0"}

I remember in high school when Tumblr was huge how big the show was and how much hype was behind it. I'm not really a huge tv person nor do I usually give into the hype of things but a few months ago I was looking up \"best television series of all time\" and of course Breaking Bad was consistently mentioned as being #1. I'm so happy I finally got around to watching the series, I'm just sad that I'm so late. The entire cast was phenomenal, every episode from the very first one pulled me into and kept me surprised, entertained and yet astonished at how beautifully it was shot. I can't even explain how incredible this show is. I hope Vince or Bryan or Aaron write a novel about the experience of it all some day.

{"original_topic": "breaking_bad", "comment": "Majority of the show happened in 1 year - and that's actually pretty realistic As most fans have figured that the majority of Breaking Bad happened in 2 years - with one year covering the first 4 seasons and first 3 episodes of season 5 and the remaining year was 13 episodes - some have said that this timeline is ridiculously unrealistic, but IMO it makes total sense, especially during binge watches. \n\nFrom my real life experiences, a lot can happen in one year, and sometimes 3-4 years and nothing changes besides that your best friend broke up with his girlfriend or your local Los Pollos joint gets shut down. It's all relative and based on perspectives. The same way people didn't know that the Beatles' discography only lasted about 7 years, because each album/image of the band was so different from one another.\n\n Breaking Bad happens to have a lot of events and multiple perspectives told through a lot of characters (who evolve a lot throughout the course of the series) with depths to them.

Even if she underwent a lot of issues with her parents and Billy but she was so mean with Lucas when he tried to tell her about the Upside Down. I get that not everyone would believe such a story and it sounded stupid something as the Upside Down exists and Will's issue, etc but still - Lucas had to keep proving himself to her all the time. \n\n\n\nThen he kept calling out Dustin about Suzie and even made his friends give up on him, pretending she knows everything again.\n\n  \nThen she influenced El - though she was right that El should have her own life and needn't do everything Mike said but she like kept telling El to dump Mike and doing stuff that made Mike and El distance themselves, it felt wrong. She was always with an attitude over everything in all seasons. \n\n\n\nThen in season 4 she just ignores everyone. I get that she feels wrong Billy died and she could not do anything about it or even wished for him to die but others too went through a lot but they did not treat people who were there for them or 'friends' as strangers or not being there for them. Even when the others approached her she acted arrogant until they came to help her to not die - Selfish!!\n\n  \nIt's definitely her character for sure but I still hate her for being so arrogant and thinking she's always the right one all the time. I still feel bad for her when she almost died in season 4 but I believe it was because of Lucas and the emotions present in the scene with everything happening and Eddie's death too.

He went from being a selfish, jealous bully to the best goddamn babysitter on the planet! Ever since he saw the Demogorgon at the Byers house in S1, he has become such a good guy. He is fiercely protective about those he cares about, especially the younger kids, who he often has to help protect as they go through with their VERY dangerous plans to combat the Upside Down.\n\nIn S4, he tells Nancy he's been thinking about what he wants his life to look like after this is all over. He's always dreamed of having a wife and 6 kids, packing them into an RV, and driving around the country to see the Grand Canyon and other great wonders of the world. He later admits to Nancy in the Upside Down that she is the wife he's been dreaming of. He has never fully gotten over her.\n\nWhile Nancy does care about Steve a lot, she has a boyfriend despite their issues and she only sees Steve as a close friend. You can tell by the look on her face she was hoping he wouldn't say that. And not only that, but Steve's dream sounds like a nightmare for someone as driven as Nancy. To have 6 kids at that point in time, Nancy would have to be a stay at home mom. And she seems like someone who would want her own career to feel fulfilled, like becoming a journalist.\n\nSomething many fans don't realize is that Steve's dream has already come true, just not in the way he had thought. He did in fact drive around in an RV with Nancy and 6 kids to prepare to go after Vecna. That sounds like an incredible setup for an absolutely devastating death.\n\nDo you think Steve will die? Will he sacrifice himself to save one of the kids or even Nancy herself? Is Steve dying the reason why Nancy is crying and washing blood off her hands in the S5 trailer? I know most fans would be heartbroken over this and I do not want it to happen, but it seems probable that it could happen.", "timestamp": 1763745182, "label": "1"}

Zero second of fillers and the storyline is just so packed and well paced. \n\nThe show had this perfect balance of mystery, horror, thrill and heart back then. Season 1 feels like lightning in a bottle. Small town, small cast and one central mission, find Will.

One girl with powers. One shady lab. That\u2019s it. And somehow it felt massive because the stakes were so personal.\n\nNo matter how big the show gets, that first season is always going to feel like lightning in a bottle. It set the tone perfectly. And this is why Season 2 is my 2nd favourite Season, it had the essence of Season 1. \n\nSeason 2 is the closest the show ever got to recapturing that formula.

{"original_topic": "euphoria", "comment": "Euphoria really destroyed its potential Hey y\u2019all, so I was bored and decided to rewatch Euphoria, and dang guys season 1 is literally so peak. I really feel like Euphoria stands out from all these other high school dramas because the aesthetic and cinematography is just beautiful, not to mention that I also feel like the characters are super realistic (not so much the whole high school aspect because every one of these bitches would be dress coded in two seconds if it was the real world lol) but just the way the characters think and feel, I mean I\u2019m in college now but when season 1 first came out, I was a sophomore in high school and the characters were just so relatable to me.\n\nBut I\u2019m not gonna lie, Euphoria really just wasted away all of its potential with season 2 and how they\u2019re treating the release of season 3. First of all, season 2 was lowkey trash. There wasn\u2019t much in the way of character development or just overall storyline, and after rewatching season 2, it really just feels kind of dragged on. When the hype was going on for season 2, people treated this show like it could do no wrong and so did I, but now I really just feel like season 2 is pretty bad. Lexi\u2019s play was also so unnecessary, like I get that they were trying to show how she was coming out of her shell and stuff, but I feel like they could have done that in a much better way, we as the audience really didn\u2019t need a whole recap of the events of season 1 in a school play that would have never been allowed to exist in a real school. Outside of just the writing though, I mean these people have waited SO LONG to release the next season, it\u2019s gonna be 4 years by the time the new season comes out. I know there were unexpected deaths from the cast which is just a tragedy, but it\u2019s been so long and there\u2019s so many people missing in the show now that I feel like people aren\u2019t even excited about this show anymore, and they should lowkey just call it good, but of course they\u2019re gonna milk it financially for all that it\u2019s worth.

I\u2019m also open to recs of other great later episodes that stand on their own, though given the time restraints I would need to be picky to weed out the lesser stuff from the great ones. \n\nAlso, one last thing; it sucks that Netflix is losing the show.  But there may be a tiny sliver of hope in that it\u2019s been reported that Netflix is privately in communication with the owners of Warner Bros, which is up for sale.   They are interested in purchasing WB, but at this current stage they\u2019re just feeling out their options versus other potential buyers to see if it\u2019s feasible not only for themselves but for WB seller.

{"original_topic": "wednesday", "comment": "I really wish Tyler and the other Hydes were written more like actual Jekyll-and-Hyde monsters Basically, exactly what the title says. A lot of the writing in this show is\u2026 let\u2019s call it \u201cwonky,\u201d and the show's lore suffers from it. The Alpha werewolf lore feels like it was made up in 5 minutes, and the Hyde lore isn\u2019t much better. The show dedicated two seasons to Hydes, and it still feels all over the place.\n\nHydes are clearly inspired by Robert Louis Stevenson's novella *The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde*. In the novella, Dr. Henry Jekyll develops a potion to separate his good and evil sides. When he drinks it, he transforms into evil Edward Hyde. Over time, Jekyll's transformations become more frequent and involuntary. The novella ends with Jekyll's final, unchangeable transformation into Hyde, who then commits suicide.\u00a0Throughout the story, Jekyll remembers everything he does as Hyde. Hyde is not a separate personality that takes over Jekyll's consciousness; rather, Hyde is Jekyll acting without his usual inhibitions, and Jekyll is fully aware of Hyde's actions. Essentially,\u00a0Jekyll tries to use the transformation to indulge in his darker impulses.\n\nThat\u2019s a very cool concept. And in Season 1, it seemed like the show was going in that direction. Tyler\u2019s first transformations are triggered by Laurel\u2019s chemicals. Maybe not at first, but over time, he becomes fully aware of his actions as a Hyde and starts enjoying them, because they give him the freedom to act on impulses he normally suppresses. That tracks with the original novella. But then the show adds lore that honestly makes everything messier: the **\u201cmaster\u201d**.\n\nAt first, I get it; writers needed a way to justify Laurel controlling Tyler and tie the twist together. Fine. But Season 2 introduces Tyler\u2019s mother, and suddenly the whole \u201cmaster\u201d concept becomes a narrative roadblock. So now apparently female Hydes don\u2019t need a master, only male Hydes do. BUT the master\u2019s control seems optional because Tyler kills Laurel and fights his own mother, AND male Hydes supposedly go \u201cinsane\u201d without a master, AND they still die young because each transformation shortens their lifespan. It really sucks being a male hyena. I mean Hyde.\n\nSo\u2026 what does a \u201cmaster\u201d even mean anymore?\n\nIt just feels *messy.* I wish they had stuck closer to the original Jekyll-and-Hyde idea rather than constantly adding plot-convenient rules that contradict earlier ones. And it\u2019s not just Hydes. The Alpha werewolf lore is equally vague and inconsistent.\n\nSeason 3 is going to expand the Hyde/werewolf lore even more with Capri and her mix of Hydes and werewolves, and honestly? I\u2019m scared that by the end of it, things are going to be even more convoluted than they already are, when they really don\u2019t need to be.\n\nAlso, as I was finishing typing all of this, I remembered that in Season 1, Xavier had some weird psychic connection to Tyler/Hyde, which the show never explained. But I guess we\u2019re never going to learn how or why that worked. Oh well\u2026\n\nJust some of my thoughts. What do you guys think about Hydes and how the show handles their lore?", "timestamp": 1763745184, "label": "1"}

{"original_topic": "wednesday", "comment": "Why Wenclair Doesn\u2019t Click for Me Anymore- as a huge fan of the ship after s1 I\u2019ve been trying really hard to figure out why Wenclair doesn\u2019t hit for me anymore, especially because I *want* to love them the way I did back in season one. I genuinely enjoyed their dynamic at first. Their contrast felt natural, their growth felt earned, and the whole \u201cOpessites attract\u201d trope actually worked really well. They had softness, tension, vulnerability, and all these tiny moments that made their connection feel warm and meaningful. I really believed in the version of them that season one was building.\n\nBut after S1, something changed for me, and it\u2019s been harder than I expected to reconnect with the ship. In season two, the relationship that hooked me just\u2026 wasn\u2019t there in the same way. They spent a lot of their scenes either arguing, miscommunicating, or being emotionally out of sync, and I never felt like the show gave them the time to rebuild or deepen the connection they started with. Even when they *did* have an emotional moment, like right before switching their bodies back, it didn\u2019t carry that same spark or weight from S1. It felt more like a leftover of what they used to be rather than a continuation of what they could\u2019ve become.\n\nI\u2019m not saying the writing was malicious or that the characters stopped caring about each other, but the shift in their dynamic made it harder for me to see the romantic potential that used to stand out so clearly. Instead of growing closer, it felt like they drifted apart, and the emotional thread between them got thinner instead of stronger. And when a ship relies heavily on chemistry, softness, and contrast, that shift really affects how you connect with it.\n\nI also want to be clear: this isn\u2019t an attack on Wenclair or the people who love it. I completely understand why the ship is meaningful to so many fans, and I think the version of Wenclair in season one was genuinely compelling. I\u2019m not trying to take that away from anyone. I\u2019m just being honest about my own experience: after S1, the show didn\u2019t give me the same feeling or energy that originally made me see their relationship in a romantic light.\n\nThe frustrating part is that I *wish* I still shipped it. I wish I could recapture that spark I felt the first time around. I wish I could go back to seeing what everyone else still sees. But the shift in how they were written in S2 changed the way I interpreted their dynamic, and no matter how much I try to get that old feeling back, I can\u2019t force it.\n\nSo this isn\u2019t a hate post, or a dismissal, or some superiority compex thing. It\u2019s just me admitting that the version of Wenclair I connected to isn\u2019t really present anymore, at least not for me. And I really wish that wasn\u2019t the case.", "timestamp": 1763745184, "label": "1"}

My friend later told me that before I arrived, he was talking to his friend about wanting to focus on his projects, but as soon as I walked in, he asked me that question.\n6. **Recently, while I was handing out papers in class**, he suddenly turned towards me and whispered something to his friend.\n7. **Another time, he asked me:** *\"Are you going to defend me at the class council?\"* (I\u2019m just an eco-delegate and not involved in the class council).

What I want to ask you guys is, I won\u2019t be able to finish the series in the time left mostly because I have a life and would need to watch multiple hours per day to finish it.

I\u2019m also open to recs of other great later episodes that stand on their own, though given the time restraints I would need to be picky to weed out the lesser stuff from the great ones. \n\nAlso, one last thing; it sucks that Netflix is losing the show.  But there may be a tiny sliver of hope in that it\u2019s been reported that Netflix is privately in communication with the owners of Warner Bros, which is up for sale.   They are interested in purchasing WB, but at this current stage they\u2019re just feeling out their options versus other potential buyers to see if it\u2019s feasible not only for themselves but for WB seller.

{"original_topic": "euphoria", "comment": "Euphoria really destroyed its potential Hey y\u2019all, so I was bored and decided to rewatch Euphoria, and dang guys season 1 is literally so peak. I really feel like Euphoria stands out from all these other high school dramas because the aesthetic and cinematography is just beautiful, not to mention that I also feel like the characters are super realistic (not so much the whole high school aspect because every one of these bitches would be dress coded in two seconds if it was the real world lol) but just the way the characters think and feel, I mean I\u2019m in college now but when season 1 first came out, I was a sophomore in high school and the characters were just so relatable to me.\n\nBut I\u2019m not gonna lie, Euphoria really just wasted away all of its potential with season 2 and how they\u2019re treating the release of season 3. First of all, season 2 was lowkey trash. There wasn\u2019t much in the way of character development or just overall storyline, and after rewatching season 2, it really just feels kind of dragged on. When the hype was going on for season 2, people treated this show like it could do no wrong and so did I, but now I really just feel like season 2 is pretty bad. Lexi\u2019s play was also so unnecessary, like I get that they were trying to show how she was coming out of her shell and stuff, but I feel like they could have done that in a much better way, we as the audience really didn\u2019t need a whole recap of the events of season 1 in a school play that would have never been allowed to exist in a real school. Outside of just the writing though, I mean these people have waited SO LONG to release the next season, it\u2019s gonna be 4 years by the time the new season comes out. I know there were unexpected deaths from the cast which is just a tragedy, but it\u2019s been so long and there\u2019s so many people missing in the show now that I feel like people aren\u2019t even excited about this show anymore, and they should lowkey just call it good, but of course they\u2019re gonna milk it financially for all that it\u2019s worth.

He went from being a selfish, jealous bully to the best goddamn babysitter on the planet! Ever since he saw the Demogorgon at the Byers house in S1, he has become such a good guy. He is fiercely protective about those he cares about, especially the younger kids, who he often has to help protect as they go through with their VERY dangerous plans to combat the Upside Down.\n\nIn S4, he tells Nancy he's been thinking about what he wants his life to look like after this is all over. He's always dreamed of having a wife and 6 kids, packing them into an RV, and driving around the country to see the Grand Canyon and other great wonders of the world. He later admits to Nancy in the Upside Down that she is the wife he's been dreaming of. He has never fully gotten over her.\n\nWhile Nancy does care about Steve a lot, she has a boyfriend despite their issues and she only sees Steve as a close friend. You can tell by the look on her face she was hoping he wouldn't say that. And not only that, but Steve's dream sounds like a nightmare for someone as driven as Nancy. To have 6 kids at that point in time, Nancy would have to be a stay at home mom. And she seems like someone who would want her own career to feel fulfilled, like becoming a journalist.\n\nSomething many fans don't realize is that Steve's dream has already come true, just not in the way he had thought. He did in fact drive around in an RV with Nancy and 6 kids to prepare to go after Vecna. That sounds like an incredible setup for an absolutely devastating death.\n\nDo you think Steve will die? Will he sacrifice himself to save one of the kids or even Nancy herself? Is Steve dying the reason why Nancy is crying and washing blood off her hands in the S5 trailer?

Season 1 feels like lightning in a bottle. Small town, small cast and one central mission, find Will.

{"original_topic": "wednesday", "comment": "I really wish Tyler and the other Hydes were written more like actual Jekyll-and-Hyde monsters Basically, exactly what the title says. A lot of the writing in this show is\u2026 let\u2019s call it \u201cwonky,\u201d and the show's lore suffers from it. The Alpha werewolf lore feels like it was made up in 5 minutes, and the Hyde lore isn\u2019t much better. The show dedicated two seasons to Hydes, and it still feels all over the place.\n\nHydes are clearly inspired by Robert Louis Stevenson's novella *The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde*. In the novella, Dr. Henry Jekyll develops a potion to separate his good and evil sides. When he drinks it, he transforms into evil Edward Hyde. Over time, Jekyll's transformations become more frequent and involuntary. The novella ends with Jekyll's final, unchangeable transformation into Hyde, who then commits suicide.\u00a0Throughout the story, Jekyll remembers everything he does as Hyde. Hyde is not a separate personality that takes over Jekyll's consciousness; rather, Hyde is Jekyll acting without his usual inhibitions, and Jekyll is fully aware of Hyde's actions. Essentially,\u00a0Jekyll tries to use the transformation to indulge in his darker impulses.\n\nThat\u2019s a very cool concept. And in Season 1, it seemed like the show was going in that direction. Tyler\u2019s first transformations are triggered by Laurel\u2019s chemicals. Maybe not at first, but over time, he becomes fully aware of his actions as a Hyde and starts enjoying them, because they give him the freedom to act on impulses he normally suppresses. That tracks with the original novella. But then the show adds lore that honestly makes everything messier: the **\u201cmaster\u201d**.\n\nAt first, I get it; writers needed a way to justify Laurel controlling Tyler and tie the twist together. Fine. But Season 2 introduces Tyler\u2019s mother, and suddenly the whole \u201cmaster\u201d concept becomes a narrative roadblock. So now apparently female Hydes don\u2019t need a master, only male Hydes do. BUT the master\u2019s control seems optional because Tyler kills Laurel and fights his own mother, AND male Hydes supposedly go \u201cinsane\u201d without a master, AND they still die young because each transformation shortens their lifespan. It really sucks being a male hyena. I mean Hyde.\n\nSo\u2026 what does a \u201cmaster\u201d even mean anymore?\n\nIt just feels *messy.* I wish they had stuck closer to the original Jekyll-and-Hyde idea rather than constantly adding plot-convenient rules that contradict earlier ones. And it\u2019s not just Hydes. The Alpha werewolf lore is equally vague and inconsistent.\n\nSeason 3 is going to expand the Hyde/werewolf lore even more with Capri and her mix of Hydes and werewolves, and honestly? I\u2019m scared that by the end of it, things are going to be even more convoluted than they already are, when they really don\u2019t need to be.\n\nAlso, as I was finishing typing all of this, I remembered that in Season 1, Xavier had some weird psychic connection to Tyler/Hyde, which the show never explained. But I guess we\u2019re never going to learn how or why that worked. Oh well\u2026\n\nJust some of my thoughts. What do you guys think about Hydes and how the show handles their lore?", "timestamp": 1763745251, "label": "1"}

{"original_topic": "wednesday", "comment": "Why Wenclair Doesn\u2019t Click for Me Anymore- as a huge fan of the ship after s1 I\u2019ve been trying really hard to figure out why Wenclair doesn\u2019t hit for me anymore, especially because I *want* to love them the way I did back in season one. I genuinely enjoyed their dynamic at first. Their contrast felt natural, their growth felt earned, and the whole \u201cOpessites attract\u201d trope actually worked really well. They had softness, tension, vulnerability, and all these tiny moments that made their connection feel warm and meaningful. I really believed in the version of them that season one was building.\n\nBut after S1, something changed for me, and it\u2019s been harder than I expected to reconnect with the ship. In season two, the relationship that hooked me just\u2026 wasn\u2019t there in the same way. They spent a lot of their scenes either arguing, miscommunicating, or being emotionally out of sync, and I never felt like the show gave them the time to rebuild or deepen the connection they started with. Even when they *did* have an emotional moment, like right before switching their bodies back, it didn\u2019t carry that same spark or weight from S1. It felt more like a leftover of what they used to be rather than a continuation of what they could\u2019ve become.\n\nI\u2019m not saying the writing was malicious or that the characters stopped caring about each other, but the shift in their dynamic made it harder for me to see the romantic potential that used to stand out so clearly. Instead of growing closer, it felt like they drifted apart, and the emotional thread between them got thinner instead of stronger. And when a ship relies heavily on chemistry, softness, and contrast, that shift really affects how you connect with it.\n\nI also want to be clear: this isn\u2019t an attack on Wenclair or the people who love it. I completely understand why the ship is meaningful to so many fans, and I think the version of Wenclair in season one was genuinely compelling. I\u2019m not trying to take that away from anyone. I\u2019m just being honest about my own experience: after S1, the show didn\u2019t give me the same feeling or energy that originally made me see their relationship in a romantic light.\n\nThe frustrating part is that I *wish* I still shipped it. I wish I could recapture that spark I felt the first time around. I wish I could go back to seeing what everyone else still sees. But the shift in how they were written in S2 changed the way I interpreted their dynamic, and no matter how much I try to get that old feeling back, I can\u2019t force it.\n\nSo this isn\u2019t a hate post, or a dismissal, or some superiority compex thing. It\u2019s just me admitting that the version of Wenclair I connected to isn\u2019t really present anymore, at least not for me. And I really wish that wasn\u2019t the case.", "timestamp": 1763745251, "label": "1"}

{"original_topic": "breaking_bad", "comment": "Daily reminder that neither Mike nor Walt were \"right\" or \"wrong\", they were both pretty terrible people I saw a post yesterday about how Mike was wrong in his argument against Walt about how they had a good thing and Walt blew it up. I actually don't disagree with everything said about Mike's \"points\". I agree with a lot of it. \n\nI think Gus had Tomas murdered or at least knew that's what the dealers would do. Think about it. Gus' big thing is that his people don't operate without his consent or knowledge. Gus liked these dealers so much, he risked his relationship with Walt to protect them. There's no way they did that without Gus having at least mild knowledge of it. I think it was a play to get Jesse killed. Jesse goes to retaliate, believing Walt wouldn't care or react or even know about it until Jesse had already gone to the dealers. They were already waiting for him, Jesse gets gunned down and Gus consoles Walt after having the dealers killed by Mike for killing Tomas and causing the situation to begin with. Now Gus has Walt, his perfect lab and no more \"junkie\". Walt knew this, he figured it out and literally told Gus that hypothetically Jesse might have believed it was Gus' doing. The show writers wouldn't have Walt say this unless they wanted us to think about it. \n\nBut does that make Walt the good guy? Or Mike? No. Mike wanted to kill Jesse for a long time. He wanted to kill Jesse just for doing drugs after his girlfriend died. Literally told Walt, \"Let me take care of it\" intending to kill Jesse at a drug house when he was consumed with grief. The same Mike that we're supposed to believe saw Jesse as a son. \n\nOn the flip side, Mike figured Walt out and knew exactly what kind of man Walt was. Walt isn't a saint. He kept Jesse alive for his own selfish reasons. He used Jesse, manipulated him, took advantage of him. And let's not forget... Walt caused Jane to turn over and choke and then stood there while she choked. Walt is also the reason they got mixed up with Gus to begin with. \n\nHere's the list of garbage moves Walt made that caused Jesse's life to get progressively worse at every turn: \n\n1. When they were making cash hand over fist, Walt freaked out about Skinny Pete getting mugged which is absolutely a thing that dealers have to deal with. This put Jesse in a compromising situation for a wad of cash that they could easily make back on the back end. No retaliation is bad for business? You can retaliate in other ways. Black list those \"customers\" and they'll find a way to pay you back. Like Jesse said, they had the best product and no one else was dealing because Tuco was dead. \n\n2. After Jesse gets caught up in a situation that leads to a man's death, he starts getting cocky and pushes for them to expand. He tries to act like a know it all, pulling out a map and *teaching* Jesse, the one who is in charge of business, new areas to expand to. Jesse literally warns him that going into new territory will lead to violent encounters but Walt is happy to milk the MISBELIEF that Jesse killed Spooge even though he knows Jesse and his crew are no killers. At this point, they don't even have junior dealers working for Badger, Skinny Pete or Combo. \n\n3. Every single thing that Jesse warned Walt about happens. First, Badger gets arrested which costs them $80k to resolve. This also loses them a dealer. And then, disaster: Combo gets killed. Where? In new territory where Gus' dealers are. This means they're down two dealers and only have Skinny Pete. And he naturally wants out because Combo is dead. This also puts Jesse under tremendous stress which leads to him leaning heavily into drugs. Walt starts worrying about how they're going to sell 50 pounds of product, but he doesn't seem AT ALL worried about Jesse. He finagles a deal with a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy and manages to get a deal to sell all of his product to Gus. At this point, there's no doubt that Gus is most likely buying it just to get it off the market. \n\nThe entire reason they end up in business with Gus, the entire reason Combo was killed by Gus' dealers, the entire reason this whole business deal with Gus even starts is due to **WALT'S EGO**. His ego is also what led to them having their run-in with Tuco. Walt was angry about $1500-$2000 a day being too slow for him and wanted to sell to a distributor. Walt was angry about needing pseudo for a traditional cook so he concocted the plan to steal methylamine. Out of everyone, Gus and Walt are the only ones who didn't want to \"get out\" of the business. \n\nMike was a lot of things, and up until he finally warmed up to Jesse, he was a piece of shit in a lot of ways, but he wasn't in the business to be in the business. He was happy to get out ahead at various points in the series. Him and Jesse were willing to walk away, sell their shares of the methylamine and walk away with more money than they could've earned in a lifetime. But who wanted to stay? Walt. \n\nIt's easy to see Walt as the reasonable one who wanted to help Jesse. But it's important to understand that almost every time Walt \"saved\" Jesse, he was saving Jesse from a horrible situation that **he himself** put Jesse in.", "timestamp": 1763745252, "label": "0"}

{"original_topic": "breaking_bad", "comment": "Daily reminder that neither Mike nor Walt were \"right\" or \"wrong\", they were both pretty terrible people I saw a post yesterday about how Mike was wrong in his argument against Walt about how they had a good thing and Walt blew it up. I actually don't disagree with everything said about Mike's \"points\". I agree with a lot of it. \n\nI think Gus had Tomas murdered or at least knew that's what the dealers would do. Think about it. Gus' big thing is that his people don't operate without his consent or knowledge. Gus liked these dealers so much, he risked his relationship with Walt to protect them. There's no way they did that without Gus having at least mild knowledge of it. I think it was a play to get Jesse killed. Jesse goes to retaliate, believing Walt wouldn't care or react or even know about it until Jesse had already gone to the dealers. They were already waiting for him, Jesse gets gunned down and Gus consoles Walt after having the dealers killed by Mike for killing Tomas and causing the situation to begin with. Now Gus has Walt, his perfect lab and no more \"junkie\". Walt knew this, he figured it out and literally told Gus that hypothetically Jesse might have believed it was Gus' doing. The show writers wouldn't have Walt say this unless they wanted us to think about it. \n\nBut does that make Walt the good guy? Or Mike? No. Mike wanted to kill Jesse for a long time. He wanted to kill Jesse just for doing drugs after his girlfriend died. Literally told Walt, \"Let me take care of it\" intending to kill Jesse at a drug house when he was consumed with grief. The same Mike that we're supposed to believe saw Jesse as a son. \n\nOn the flip side, Mike figured Walt out and knew exactly what kind of man Walt was. Walt isn't a saint. He kept Jesse alive for his own selfish reasons. He used Jesse, manipulated him, took advantage of him. And let's not forget... Walt caused Jane to turn over and choke and then stood there while she choked. Walt is also the reason they got mixed up with Gus to begin with. \n\nHere's the list of garbage moves Walt made that caused Jesse's life to get progressively worse at every turn: \n\n1. When they were making cash hand over fist, Walt freaked out about Skinny Pete getting mugged which is absolutely a thing that dealers have to deal with. This put Jesse in a compromising situation for a wad of cash that they could easily make back on the back end. No retaliation is bad for business? You can retaliate in other ways. Black list those \"customers\" and they'll find a way to pay you back. Like Jesse said, they had the best product and no one else was dealing because Tuco was dead. \n\n2. After Jesse gets caught up in a situation that leads to a man's death, he starts getting cocky and pushes for them to expand. He tries to act like a know it all, pulling out a map and *teaching* Jesse, the one who is in charge of business, new areas to expand to. Jesse literally warns him that going into new territory will lead to violent encounters but Walt is happy to milk the MISBELIEF that Jesse killed Spooge even though he knows Jesse and his crew are no killers. At this point, they don't even have junior dealers working for Badger, Skinny Pete or Combo. \n\n3. Every single thing that Jesse warned Walt about happens. First, Badger gets arrested which costs them $80k to resolve. This also loses them a dealer. And then, disaster: Combo gets killed. Where? In new territory where Gus' dealers are. This means they're down two dealers and only have Skinny Pete. And he naturally wants out because Combo is dead. This also puts Jesse under tremendous stress which leads to him leaning heavily into drugs. Walt starts worrying about how they're going to sell 50 pounds of product, but he doesn't seem AT ALL worried about Jesse. He finagles a deal with a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy and manages to get a deal to sell all of his product to Gus. At this point, there's no doubt that Gus is most likely buying it just to get it off the market. \n\nThe entire reason they end up in business with Gus, the entire reason Combo was killed by Gus' dealers, the entire reason this whole business deal with Gus even starts is due to **WALT'S EGO**. His ego is also what led to them having their run-in with Tuco. Walt was angry about $1500-$2000 a day being too slow for him and wanted to sell to a distributor. Walt was angry about needing pseudo for a traditional cook so he concocted the plan to steal methylamine. Out of everyone, Gus and Walt are the only ones who didn't want to \"get out\" of the business. \n\nMike was a lot of things, and up until he finally warmed up to Jesse, he was a piece of shit in a lot of ways, but he wasn't in the business to be in the business. He was happy to get out ahead at various points in the series. Him and Jesse were willing to walk away, sell their shares of the methylamine and walk away with more money than they could've earned in a lifetime. But who wanted to stay? Walt. \n\nIt's easy to see Walt as the reasonable one who wanted to help Jesse. But it's important to understand that almost every time Walt \"saved\" Jesse, he was saving Jesse from a horrible situation that **he himself** put Jesse in.", "timestamp": 1763745286, "label": "0"}

It's all relative and based on perspectives. The same way people didn't know that the Beatles' discography only lasted about 7 years, because each album/image of the band was so different from one another.\n\n Breaking Bad happens to have a lot of events and multiple perspectives told through a lot of characters (who evolve a lot throughout the course of the series) with depths to them.

{"original_topic": "wednesday", "comment": "I really wish Tyler and the other Hydes were written more like actual Jekyll-and-Hyde monsters Basically, exactly what the title says. A lot of the writing in this show is\u2026 let\u2019s call it \u201cwonky,\u201d and the show's lore suffers from it. The Alpha werewolf lore feels like it was made up in 5 minutes, and the Hyde lore isn\u2019t much better. The show dedicated two seasons to Hydes, and it still feels all over the place.\n\nHydes are clearly inspired by Robert Louis Stevenson's novella *The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde*. In the novella, Dr. Henry Jekyll develops a potion to separate his good and evil sides. When he drinks it, he transforms into evil Edward Hyde. Over time, Jekyll's transformations become more frequent and involuntary. The novella ends with Jekyll's final, unchangeable transformation into Hyde, who then commits suicide.\u00a0Throughout the story, Jekyll remembers everything he does as Hyde. Hyde is not a separate personality that takes over Jekyll's consciousness; rather, Hyde is Jekyll acting without his usual inhibitions, and Jekyll is fully aware of Hyde's actions. Essentially,\u00a0Jekyll tries to use the transformation to indulge in his darker impulses.\n\nThat\u2019s a very cool concept. And in Season 1, it seemed like the show was going in that direction. Tyler\u2019s first transformations are triggered by Laurel\u2019s chemicals. Maybe not at first, but over time, he becomes fully aware of his actions as a Hyde and starts enjoying them, because they give him the freedom to act on impulses he normally suppresses. That tracks with the original novella. But then the show adds lore that honestly makes everything messier: the **\u201cmaster\u201d**.\n\nAt first, I get it; writers needed a way to justify Laurel controlling Tyler and tie the twist together. Fine. But Season 2 introduces Tyler\u2019s mother, and suddenly the whole \u201cmaster\u201d concept becomes a narrative roadblock. So now apparently female Hydes don\u2019t need a master, only male Hydes do. BUT the master\u2019s control seems optional because Tyler kills Laurel and fights his own mother, AND male Hydes supposedly go \u201cinsane\u201d without a master, AND they still die young because each transformation shortens their lifespan. It really sucks being a male hyena. I mean Hyde.\n\nSo\u2026 what does a \u201cmaster\u201d even mean anymore?\n\nIt just feels *messy.* I wish they had stuck closer to the original Jekyll-and-Hyde idea rather than constantly adding plot-convenient rules that contradict earlier ones. And it\u2019s not just Hydes. The Alpha werewolf lore is equally vague and inconsistent.\n\nSeason 3 is going to expand the Hyde/werewolf lore even more with Capri and her mix of Hydes and werewolves, and honestly?

{"original_topic": "wednesday", "comment": "Why Wenclair Doesn\u2019t Click for Me Anymore- as a huge fan of the ship after s1 I\u2019ve been trying really hard to figure out why Wenclair doesn\u2019t hit for me anymore, especially because I *want* to love them the way I did back in season one. I genuinely enjoyed their dynamic at first. Their contrast felt natural, their growth felt earned, and the whole \u201cOpessites attract\u201d trope actually worked really well. They had softness, tension, vulnerability, and all these tiny moments that made their connection feel warm and meaningful. I really believed in the version of them that season one was building.\n\nBut after S1, something changed for me, and it\u2019s been harder than I expected to reconnect with the ship. In season two, the relationship that hooked me just\u2026 wasn\u2019t there in the same way. They spent a lot of their scenes either arguing, miscommunicating, or being emotionally out of sync, and I never felt like the show gave them the time to rebuild or deepen the connection they started with. Even when they *did* have an emotional moment, like right before switching their bodies back, it didn\u2019t carry that same spark or weight from S1. It felt more like a leftover of what they used to be rather than a continuation of what they could\u2019ve become.\n\nI\u2019m not saying the writing was malicious or that the characters stopped caring about each other, but the shift in their dynamic made it harder for me to see the romantic potential that used to stand out so clearly. Instead of growing closer, it felt like they drifted apart, and the emotional thread between them got thinner instead of stronger. And when a ship relies heavily on chemistry, softness, and contrast, that shift really affects how you connect with it.\n\nI also want to be clear: this isn\u2019t an attack on Wenclair or the people who love it. I completely understand why the ship is meaningful to so many fans, and I think the version of Wenclair in season one was genuinely compelling. I\u2019m not trying to take that away from anyone. I\u2019m just being honest about my own experience: after S1, the show didn\u2019t give me the same feeling or energy that originally made me see their relationship in a romantic light.\n\nThe frustrating part is that I *wish* I still shipped it. I wish I could recapture that spark I felt the first time around. I wish I could go back to seeing what everyone else still sees. But the shift in how they were written in S2 changed the way I interpreted their dynamic, and no matter how much I try to get that old feeling back, I can\u2019t force it.\n\nSo this isn\u2019t a hate post, or a dismissal, or some superiority compex thing. It\u2019s just me admitting that the version of Wenclair I connected to isn\u2019t really present anymore, at least not for me. And I really wish that wasn\u2019t the case.", "timestamp": 1763745287, "label": "1"}

I really feel like Euphoria stands out from all these other high school dramas because the aesthetic and cinematography is just beautiful, not to mention that I also feel like the characters are super realistic (not so much the whole high school aspect because every one of these bitches would be dress coded in two seconds if it was the real world lol) but just the way the characters think and feel, I mean I\u2019m in college now but when season 1 first came out, I was a sophomore in high school and the characters were just so relatable to me.\n\nBut I\u2019m not gonna lie, Euphoria really just wasted away all of its potential with season 2 and how they\u2019re treating the release of season 3. First of all, season 2 was lowkey trash. There wasn\u2019t much in the way of character development or just overall storyline, and after rewatching season 2, it really just feels kind of dragged on. When the hype was going on for season 2, people treated this show like it could do no wrong and so did I, but now I really just feel like season 2 is pretty bad. Lexi\u2019s play was also so unnecessary, like I get that they were trying to show how she was coming out of her shell and stuff, but I feel like they could have done that in a much better way, we as the audience really didn\u2019t need a whole recap of the events of season 1 in a school play that would have never been allowed to exist in a real school. Outside of just the writing though, I mean these people have waited SO LONG to release the next season, it\u2019s gonna be 4 years by the time the new season comes out. I know there were unexpected deaths from the cast which is just a tragedy, but it\u2019s been so long and there\u2019s so many people missing in the show now that I feel like people aren\u2019t even excited about this show anymore, and they should lowkey just call it good, but of course they\u2019re gonna milk it financially for all that it\u2019s worth.

He went from being a selfish, jealous bully to the best goddamn babysitter on the planet! Ever since he saw the Demogorgon at the Byers house in S1, he has become such a good guy. He is fiercely protective about those he cares about, especially the younger kids, who he often has to help protect as they go through with their VERY dangerous plans to combat the Upside Down.\n\nIn S4, he tells Nancy he's been thinking about what he wants his life to look like after this is all over. He's always dreamed of having a wife and 6 kids, packing them into an RV, and driving around the country to see the Grand Canyon and other great wonders of the world. He later admits to Nancy in the Upside Down that she is the wife he's been dreaming of. He has never fully gotten over her.\n\nWhile Nancy does care about Steve a lot, she has a boyfriend despite their issues and she only sees Steve as a close friend. You can tell by the look on her face she was hoping he wouldn't say that. And not only that, but Steve's dream sounds like a nightmare for someone as driven as Nancy. To have 6 kids at that point in time, Nancy would have to be a stay at home mom. And she seems like someone who would want her own career to feel fulfilled, like becoming a journalist.\n\nSomething many fans don't realize is that Steve's dream has already come true, just not in the way he had thought. He did in fact drive around in an RV with Nancy and 6 kids to prepare to go after Vecna. That sounds like an incredible setup for an absolutely devastating death.\n\nDo you think Steve will die? Will he sacrifice himself to save one of the kids or even Nancy herself? Is Steve dying the reason why Nancy is crying and washing blood off her hands in the S5 trailer?

{"original_topic": "stranger_things", "comment": "Stranger Things had an insane first Season. Season 1 is so packed in its plotline. Like they didn't wasted a single second. Zero second of fillers and the storyline is just so packed and well paced. \n\nThe show had this perfect balance of mystery, horror, thrill and heart back then. Season 1 feels like lightning in a bottle. Small town, small cast and one central mission, find Will. The world hadn't exploded into ten different storylines yet, the tension stayed insane. \n\nThe scale being small did wonders. One missing kid. One group of boys. One grieving mom. One girl with powers. One shady lab. That\u2019s it. And somehow it felt massive because the stakes were so personal.\n\nNo matter how big the show gets, that first season is always going to feel like lightning in a bottle. It set the tone perfectly. And this is why Season 2 is my 2nd favourite Season, it had the essence of Season 1. \n\nSeason 2 is the closest the show ever got to recapturing that formula. It felt like Hawkins wasn\u2019t drowning in plot threads unlike the later seasons. The characters were dealing with the fallout of Season 1, everyone was still connected, the tone stayed grounded, and Will\u2019s possession arc was just so damn strong.", "timestamp": 1763745289, "label": "1"}

So I think most of you are aware that the show is scheduled to leave Netflix altogether in roughly a month.  \n\nI am running through the series, but I started about three months ago and am currently at the midway point of season 9.  What I want to ask you guys is, I won\u2019t be able to finish the series in the time left mostly because I have a life and would need to watch multiple hours per day to finish it.  But I have heard about two episodes that not only sound super interesting, but also get great IMDb ratings that I\u2019m really interested in watching:  \u201cScoobynatural\u201c and \u201cBaby.\u201d  Can I watch those right now, or at least very soon, and not be spoiling anything?  In other words, will I be able to watch it and enjoy/understand it without first burning through the series from where I am now?\n\nI appreciate the advice while avoiding spoilers from post season 9.   I\u2019m also open to recs of other great later episodes that stand on their own, though given the time restraints I would need to be picky to weed out the lesser stuff from the great ones. \n\nAlso, one last thing; it sucks that Netflix is losing the show.  But there may be a tiny sliver of hope in that it\u2019s been reported that Netflix is privately in communication with the owners of Warner Bros, which is up for sale.   They are interested in purchasing WB, but at this current stage they\u2019re just feeling out their options versus other potential buyers to see if it\u2019s feasible not only for themselves but for WB seller.

There's this episode, Azazel feeding demon blood to six-month old Sam, the woman in white basically force-kissing and abusing Sam in the pilot, Meg possessing Sam in S2E14, Ruby exploiting him with demon blood in season 4, the two hunters literally forcing demon blood down Sam's throat while physically restraining him in S5E3, that whole Becky plot in S7E8, and more.

Here are the facts:\n\n1. **At the beginning of the school year**, he often tried to make eye contact with me. I\u2019m very shy, so I avoided it. Then, he started calling me *Baka* (a Japanese word for \"idiot\") discreetly, but I could clearly hear him.\n2. **As time went on, his behavior changed**. During a school trip, on the bus, he suddenly said: *\"Wesh \\[my name\\], how are you!?\"* Then, he kept looking at me. Every time I looked at him, he would look away, and when I turned back to the window, he would look at me again. This went on for a while until I got too embarrassed and turned completely away.\n3. **One day in class**, I was talking to his little sister (we\u2019ve become friends) a bit away from the group. When we decided to rejoin the others, he suddenly rushed towards my friend, stopped abruptly when he saw me, and then went back to his friends.\n4. **His little sister told me things about him**. She said he talked about me at home, saying that at the beginning of the year, he had certain thoughts about me, but now it\u2019s better.

I replied a bit curtly (I regret it). My friend later told me that before I arrived, he was talking to his friend about wanting to focus on his projects, but as soon as I walked in, he asked me that question.\n6. **Recently, while I was handing out papers in class**, he suddenly turned towards me and whispered something to his friend.\n7. **Another time, he asked me:** *\"Are you going to defend me at the class council?\"* (I\u2019m just an eco-delegate and not involved in the class council). Right after asking, he left without waiting for an answer.\n\nI\u2019m confused. He seems comfortable talking to other girls, but with me, he acts distant and ambiguous.

Then, he started calling me *Baka* (a Japanese word for \"idiot\") discreetly, but I could clearly hear him.\n2. **As time went on, his behavior changed**. During a school trip, on the bus, he suddenly said: *\"Wesh \\[my name\\], how are you!?\"* Then, he kept looking at me. Every time I looked at him, he would look away, and when I turned back to the window, he would look at me again. This went on for a while until I got too embarrassed and turned completely away.\n3. **One day in class**, I was talking to his little sister (we\u2019ve become friends) a bit away from the group. When we decided to rejoin the others, he suddenly rushed towards my friend, stopped abruptly when he saw me, and then went back to his friends.\n4. **His little sister told me things about him**. She said he talked about me at home, saying that at the beginning of the year, he had certain thoughts about me, but now it\u2019s better. He also said that I was nice and that I didn\u2019t talk to boys, which made me a \"good Muslim.\" He asked her not to tell me, but of course, she did.\n5. **One day, he asked if I was Moroccan**. I replied a bit curtly (I regret it). My friend later told me that before I arrived, he was talking to his friend about wanting to focus on his projects, but as soon as I walked in, he asked me that question.\n6. **Recently, while I was handing out papers in class**, he suddenly turned towards me and whispered something to his friend.\n7. **Another time, he asked me:** *\"Are you going to defend me at the class council?\"* (I\u2019m just an eco-delegate and not involved in the class council). Right after asking, he left without waiting for an answer.\n\nI\u2019m confused. He seems comfortable talking to other girls, but with me, he acts distant and ambiguous. Do you think he might be interested in me, or am I reading too much into this? How should I react?\n\nThank you in advance for your advice!\n\nAsk me questions if some points are not clear :)", "timestamp": 1763745354, "label": "0"}

Even if she underwent a lot of issues with her parents and Billy but she was so mean with Lucas when he tried to tell her about the Upside Down. I get that not everyone would believe such a story and it sounded stupid something as the Upside Down exists and Will's issue, etc but still - Lucas had to keep proving himself to her all the time. \n\n\n\nThen he kept calling out Dustin about Suzie and even made his friends give up on him, pretending she knows everything again.\n\n  \nThen she influenced El - though she was right that El should have her own life and needn't do everything Mike said but she like kept telling El to dump Mike and doing stuff that made Mike and El distance themselves, it felt wrong. She was always with an attitude over everything in all seasons. \n\n\n\nThen in season 4 she just ignores everyone. I get that she feels wrong Billy died and she could not do anything about it or even wished for him to die but others too went through a lot but they did not treat people who were there for them or 'friends' as strangers or not being there for them. Even when the others approached her she acted arrogant until they came to help her to not die - Selfish!!\n\n  \nIt's definitely her character for sure but I still hate her for being so arrogant and thinking she's always the right one all the time.

{"original_topic": "stranger_things", "comment": "Day 120 - Countdown to Stranger Things Season 5 || Steve Theory Steve \"The Hair\" Harrington has had the best redemption arc I have ever seen. He went from being a selfish, jealous bully to the best goddamn babysitter on the planet! Ever since he saw the Demogorgon at the Byers house in S1, he has become such a good guy. He is fiercely protective about those he cares about, especially the younger kids, who he often has to help protect as they go through with their VERY dangerous plans to combat the Upside Down.\n\nIn S4, he tells Nancy he's been thinking about what he wants his life to look like after this is all over. He's always dreamed of having a wife and 6 kids, packing them into an RV, and driving around the country to see the Grand Canyon and other great wonders of the world. He later admits to Nancy in the Upside Down that she is the wife he's been dreaming of. He has never fully gotten over her.\n\nWhile Nancy does care about Steve a lot, she has a boyfriend despite their issues and she only sees Steve as a close friend. You can tell by the look on her face she was hoping he wouldn't say that. And not only that, but Steve's dream sounds like a nightmare for someone as driven as Nancy. To have 6 kids at that point in time, Nancy would have to be a stay at home mom. And she seems like someone who would want her own career to feel fulfilled, like becoming a journalist.\n\nSomething many fans don't realize is that Steve's dream has already come true, just not in the way he had thought. He did in fact drive around in an RV with Nancy and 6 kids to prepare to go after Vecna. That sounds like an incredible setup for an absolutely devastating death.\n\nDo you think Steve will die? Will he sacrifice himself to save one of the kids or even Nancy herself? Is Steve dying the reason why Nancy is crying and washing blood off her hands in the S5 trailer? I know most fans would be heartbroken over this and I do not want it to happen, but it seems probable that it could happen.", "timestamp": 1763745354, "label": "1"}

Zero second of fillers and the storyline is just so packed and well paced. \n\nThe show had this perfect balance of mystery, horror, thrill and heart back then. Season 1 feels like lightning in a bottle. Small town, small cast and one central mission, find Will. The world hadn't exploded into ten different storylines yet, the tension stayed insane. \n\nThe scale being small did wonders. One missing kid. One group of boys. One grieving mom. One girl with powers. One shady lab. That\u2019s it. And somehow it felt massive because the stakes were so personal.\n\nNo matter how big the show gets, that first season is always going to feel like lightning in a bottle. It set the tone perfectly. And this is why Season 2 is my 2nd favourite Season, it had the essence of Season 1. \n\nSeason 2 is the closest the show ever got to recapturing that formula.

{"original_topic": "euphoria", "comment": "Euphoria really destroyed its potential Hey y\u2019all, so I was bored and decided to rewatch Euphoria, and dang guys season 1 is literally so peak. I really feel like Euphoria stands out from all these other high school dramas because the aesthetic and cinematography is just beautiful, not to mention that I also feel like the characters are super realistic (not so much the whole high school aspect because every one of these bitches would be dress coded in two seconds if it was the real world lol) but just the way the characters think and feel, I mean I\u2019m in college now but when season 1 first came out, I was a sophomore in high school and the characters were just so relatable to me.\n\nBut I\u2019m not gonna lie, Euphoria really just wasted away all of its potential with season 2 and how they\u2019re treating the release of season 3. First of all, season 2 was lowkey trash. There wasn\u2019t much in the way of character development or just overall storyline, and after rewatching season 2, it really just feels kind of dragged on. When the hype was going on for season 2, people treated this show like it could do no wrong and so did I, but now I really just feel like season 2 is pretty bad. Lexi\u2019s play was also so unnecessary, like I get that they were trying to show how she was coming out of her shell and stuff, but I feel like they could have done that in a much better way, we as the audience really didn\u2019t need a whole recap of the events of season 1 in a school play that would have never been allowed to exist in a real school. Outside of just the writing though, I mean these people have waited SO LONG to release the next season, it\u2019s gonna be 4 years by the time the new season comes out. I know there were unexpected deaths from the cast which is just a tragedy, but it\u2019s been so long and there\u2019s so many people missing in the show now that I feel like people aren\u2019t even excited about this show anymore, and they should lowkey just call it good, but of course they\u2019re gonna milk it financially for all that it\u2019s worth.

{"original_topic": "wednesday", "comment": "I really wish Tyler and the other Hydes were written more like actual Jekyll-and-Hyde monsters Basically, exactly what the title says. A lot of the writing in this show is\u2026 let\u2019s call it \u201cwonky,\u201d and the show's lore suffers from it. The Alpha werewolf lore feels like it was made up in 5 minutes, and the Hyde lore isn\u2019t much better. The show dedicated two seasons to Hydes, and it still feels all over the place.\n\nHydes are clearly inspired by Robert Louis Stevenson's novella *The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde*. In the novella, Dr. Henry Jekyll develops a potion to separate his good and evil sides. When he drinks it, he transforms into evil Edward Hyde. Over time, Jekyll's transformations become more frequent and involuntary. The novella ends with Jekyll's final, unchangeable transformation into Hyde, who then commits suicide.\u00a0Throughout the story, Jekyll remembers everything he does as Hyde. Hyde is not a separate personality that takes over Jekyll's consciousness; rather, Hyde is Jekyll acting without his usual inhibitions, and Jekyll is fully aware of Hyde's actions. Essentially,\u00a0Jekyll tries to use the transformation to indulge in his darker impulses.\n\nThat\u2019s a very cool concept. And in Season 1, it seemed like the show was going in that direction. Tyler\u2019s first transformations are triggered by Laurel\u2019s chemicals. Maybe not at first, but over time, he becomes fully aware of his actions as a Hyde and starts enjoying them, because they give him the freedom to act on impulses he normally suppresses. That tracks with the original novella. But then the show adds lore that honestly makes everything messier: the **\u201cmaster\u201d**.\n\nAt first, I get it; writers needed a way to justify Laurel controlling Tyler and tie the twist together. Fine. But Season 2 introduces Tyler\u2019s mother, and suddenly the whole \u201cmaster\u201d concept becomes a narrative roadblock. So now apparently female Hydes don\u2019t need a master, only male Hydes do. BUT the master\u2019s control seems optional because Tyler kills Laurel and fights his own mother, AND male Hydes supposedly go \u201cinsane\u201d without a master, AND they still die young because each transformation shortens their lifespan. It really sucks being a male hyena. I mean Hyde.\n\nSo\u2026 what does a \u201cmaster\u201d even mean anymore?\n\nIt just feels *messy.* I wish they had stuck closer to the original Jekyll-and-Hyde idea rather than constantly adding plot-convenient rules that contradict earlier ones. And it\u2019s not just Hydes. The Alpha werewolf lore is equally vague and inconsistent.\n\nSeason 3 is going to expand the Hyde/werewolf lore even more with Capri and her mix of Hydes and werewolves, and honestly? I\u2019m scared that by the end of it, things are going to be even more convoluted than they already are, when they really don\u2019t need to be.\n\nAlso, as I was finishing typing all of this, I remembered that in Season 1, Xavier had some weird psychic connection to Tyler/Hyde, which the show never explained. But I guess we\u2019re never going to learn how or why that worked. Oh well\u2026\n\nJust some of my thoughts. What do you guys think about Hydes and how the show handles their lore?", "timestamp": 1763745355, "label": "1"}

{"original_topic": "wednesday", "comment": "Why Wenclair Doesn\u2019t Click for Me Anymore- as a huge fan of the ship after s1 I\u2019ve been trying really hard to figure out why Wenclair doesn\u2019t hit for me anymore, especially because I *want* to love them the way I did back in season one. I genuinely enjoyed their dynamic at first. Their contrast felt natural, their growth felt earned, and the whole \u201cOpessites attract\u201d trope actually worked really well. They had softness, tension, vulnerability, and all these tiny moments that made their connection feel warm and meaningful. I really believed in the version of them that season one was building.\n\nBut after S1, something changed for me, and it\u2019s been harder than I expected to reconnect with the ship. In season two, the relationship that hooked me just\u2026 wasn\u2019t there in the same way. They spent a lot of their scenes either arguing, miscommunicating, or being emotionally out of sync, and I never felt like the show gave them the time to rebuild or deepen the connection they started with. Even when they *did* have an emotional moment, like right before switching their bodies back, it didn\u2019t carry that same spark or weight from S1. It felt more like a leftover of what they used to be rather than a continuation of what they could\u2019ve become.\n\nI\u2019m not saying the writing was malicious or that the characters stopped caring about each other, but the shift in their dynamic made it harder for me to see the romantic potential that used to stand out so clearly. Instead of growing closer, it felt like they drifted apart, and the emotional thread between them got thinner instead of stronger. And when a ship relies heavily on chemistry, softness, and contrast, that shift really affects how you connect with it.\n\nI also want to be clear: this isn\u2019t an attack on Wenclair or the people who love it. I completely understand why the ship is meaningful to so many fans, and I think the version of Wenclair in season one was genuinely compelling. I\u2019m not trying to take that away from anyone. I\u2019m just being honest about my own experience: after S1, the show didn\u2019t give me the same feeling or energy that originally made me see their relationship in a romantic light.\n\nThe frustrating part is that I *wish* I still shipped it. I wish I could recapture that spark I felt the first time around. I wish I could go back to seeing what everyone else still sees. But the shift in how they were written in S2 changed the way I interpreted their dynamic, and no matter how much I try to get that old feeling back, I can\u2019t force it.\n\nSo this isn\u2019t a hate post, or a dismissal, or some superiority compex thing. It\u2019s just me admitting that the version of Wenclair I connected to isn\u2019t really present anymore, at least not for me. And I really wish that wasn\u2019t the case.", "timestamp": 1763745355, "label": "1"}

{"original_topic": "supernatural", "comment": "Chronologically Sound? So I think most of you are aware that the show is scheduled to leave Netflix altogether in roughly a month.  \n\nI am running through the series, but I started about three months ago and am currently at the midway point of season 9.  What I want to ask you guys is, I won\u2019t be able to finish the series in the time left mostly because I have a life and would need to watch multiple hours per day to finish it.  But I have heard about two episodes that not only sound super interesting, but also get great IMDb ratings that I\u2019m really interested in watching:  \u201cScoobynatural\u201c and \u201cBaby.\u201d  Can I watch those right now, or at least very soon, and not be spoiling anything?  In other words, will I be able to watch it and enjoy/understand it without first burning through the series from where I am now?\n\nI appreciate the advice while avoiding spoilers from post season 9.   I\u2019m also open to recs of other great later episodes that stand on their own, though given the time restraints I would need to be picky to weed out the lesser stuff from the great ones. \n\nAlso, one last thing; it sucks that Netflix is losing the show.  But there may be a tiny sliver of hope in that it\u2019s been reported that Netflix is privately in communication with the owners of Warner Bros, which is up for sale.   They are interested in purchasing WB, but at this current stage they\u2019re just feeling out their options versus other potential buyers to see if it\u2019s feasible not only for themselves but for WB seller.  And of course, if they can purchase WB they would be outright getting the rights for Supernatural amongst their entire vast catalogue.  It probably won\u2019t happen soon, but it could still happen.  Something to keep an eye on.\n\nI appreciate any comments about the two episodes referenced, cheers.  \u270c\ufe0f", "timestamp": 1763745356, "label": "0"}

I get this was supposed to be some unusual thing they haven't really experienced before, but the amount of times throughout this show when Sam's own body gets taken advantage of or violated is very unsettling. There's this episode, Azazel feeding demon blood to six-month old Sam, the woman in white basically force-kissing and abusing Sam in the pilot, Meg possessing Sam in S2E14, Ruby exploiting him with demon blood in season 4, the two hunters literally forcing demon blood down Sam's throat while physically restraining him in S5E3, that whole Becky plot in S7E8, and more.

Sam does everything he can to save Dean from the Mark and from being a demon. He stretches himself thin emotionally and physically, and he never once attacks Dean the way Dean attacks him.

{"original_topic": "breaking_bad", "comment": "Daily reminder that neither Mike nor Walt were \"right\" or \"wrong\", they were both pretty terrible people I saw a post yesterday about how Mike was wrong in his argument against Walt about how they had a good thing and Walt blew it up. I actually don't disagree with everything said about Mike's \"points\". I agree with a lot of it. \n\nI think Gus had Tomas murdered or at least knew that's what the dealers would do. Think about it. Gus' big thing is that his people don't operate without his consent or knowledge. Gus liked these dealers so much, he risked his relationship with Walt to protect them. There's no way they did that without Gus having at least mild knowledge of it. I think it was a play to get Jesse killed. Jesse goes to retaliate, believing Walt wouldn't care or react or even know about it until Jesse had already gone to the dealers. They were already waiting for him, Jesse gets gunned down and Gus consoles Walt after having the dealers killed by Mike for killing Tomas and causing the situation to begin with. Now Gus has Walt, his perfect lab and no more \"junkie\". Walt knew this, he figured it out and literally told Gus that hypothetically Jesse might have believed it was Gus' doing. The show writers wouldn't have Walt say this unless they wanted us to think about it. \n\nBut does that make Walt the good guy? Or Mike? No. Mike wanted to kill Jesse for a long time. He wanted to kill Jesse just for doing drugs after his girlfriend died. Literally told Walt, \"Let me take care of it\" intending to kill Jesse at a drug house when he was consumed with grief. The same Mike that we're supposed to believe saw Jesse as a son. \n\nOn the flip side, Mike figured Walt out and knew exactly what kind of man Walt was. Walt isn't a saint. He kept Jesse alive for his own selfish reasons. He used Jesse, manipulated him, took advantage of him. And let's not forget... Walt caused Jane to turn over and choke and then stood there while she choked. Walt is also the reason they got mixed up with Gus to begin with. \n\nHere's the list of garbage moves Walt made that caused Jesse's life to get progressively worse at every turn: \n\n1. When they were making cash hand over fist, Walt freaked out about Skinny Pete getting mugged which is absolutely a thing that dealers have to deal with. This put Jesse in a compromising situation for a wad of cash that they could easily make back on the back end. No retaliation is bad for business? You can retaliate in other ways. Black list those \"customers\" and they'll find a way to pay you back. Like Jesse said, they had the best product and no one else was dealing because Tuco was dead. \n\n2. After Jesse gets caught up in a situation that leads to a man's death, he starts getting cocky and pushes for them to expand. He tries to act like a know it all, pulling out a map and *teaching* Jesse, the one who is in charge of business, new areas to expand to. Jesse literally warns him that going into new territory will lead to violent encounters but Walt is happy to milk the MISBELIEF that Jesse killed Spooge even though he knows Jesse and his crew are no killers. At this point, they don't even have junior dealers working for Badger, Skinny Pete or Combo. \n\n3. Every single thing that Jesse warned Walt about happens. First, Badger gets arrested which costs them $80k to resolve. This also loses them a dealer. And then, disaster: Combo gets killed. Where? In new territory where Gus' dealers are. This means they're down two dealers and only have Skinny Pete. And he naturally wants out because Combo is dead. This also puts Jesse under tremendous stress which leads to him leaning heavily into drugs. Walt starts worrying about how they're going to sell 50 pounds of product, but he doesn't seem AT ALL worried about Jesse. He finagles a deal with a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy and manages to get a deal to sell all of his product to Gus. At this point, there's no doubt that Gus is most likely buying it just to get it off the market. \n\nThe entire reason they end up in business with Gus, the entire reason Combo was killed by Gus' dealers, the entire reason this whole business deal with Gus even starts is due to **WALT'S EGO**. His ego is also what led to them having their run-in with Tuco. Walt was angry about $1500-$2000 a day being too slow for him and wanted to sell to a distributor. Walt was angry about needing pseudo for a traditional cook so he concocted the plan to steal methylamine. Out of everyone, Gus and Walt are the only ones who didn't want to \"get out\" of the business. \n\nMike was a lot of things, and up until he finally warmed up to Jesse, he was a piece of shit in a lot of ways, but he wasn't in the business to be in the business. He was happy to get out ahead at various points in the series. Him and Jesse were willing to walk away, sell their shares of the methylamine and walk away with more money than they could've earned in a lifetime. But who wanted to stay? Walt. \n\nIt's easy to see Walt as the reasonable one who wanted to help Jesse. But it's important to understand that almost every time Walt \"saved\" Jesse, he was saving Jesse from a horrible situation that **he himself** put Jesse in.", "timestamp": 1763745356, "label": "0"}

It's all relative and based on perspectives. The same way people didn't know that the Beatles' discography only lasted about 7 years, because each album/image of the band was so different from one another.\n\n Breaking Bad happens to have a lot of events and multiple perspectives told through a lot of characters (who evolve a lot throughout the course of the series) with depths to them.

{"original_topic": "wednesday", "comment": "I really wish Tyler and the other Hydes were written more like actual Jekyll-and-Hyde monsters Basically, exactly what the title says. A lot of the writing in this show is\u2026 let\u2019s call it \u201cwonky,\u201d and the show's lore suffers from it. The Alpha werewolf lore feels like it was made up in 5 minutes, and the Hyde lore isn\u2019t much better. The show dedicated two seasons to Hydes, and it still feels all over the place.\n\nHydes are clearly inspired by Robert Louis Stevenson's novella *The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde*. In the novella, Dr. Henry Jekyll develops a potion to separate his good and evil sides. When he drinks it, he transforms into evil Edward Hyde. Over time, Jekyll's transformations become more frequent and involuntary. The novella ends with Jekyll's final, unchangeable transformation into Hyde, who then commits suicide.\u00a0Throughout the story, Jekyll remembers everything he does as Hyde. Hyde is not a separate personality that takes over Jekyll's consciousness; rather, Hyde is Jekyll acting without his usual inhibitions, and Jekyll is fully aware of Hyde's actions. Essentially,\u00a0Jekyll tries to use the transformation to indulge in his darker impulses.\n\nThat\u2019s a very cool concept. And in Season 1, it seemed like the show was going in that direction. Tyler\u2019s first transformations are triggered by Laurel\u2019s chemicals. Maybe not at first, but over time, he becomes fully aware of his actions as a Hyde and starts enjoying them, because they give him the freedom to act on impulses he normally suppresses. That tracks with the original novella. But then the show adds lore that honestly makes everything messier: the **\u201cmaster\u201d**.\n\nAt first, I get it; writers needed a way to justify Laurel controlling Tyler and tie the twist together. Fine. But Season 2 introduces Tyler\u2019s mother, and suddenly the whole \u201cmaster\u201d concept becomes a narrative roadblock. So now apparently female Hydes don\u2019t need a master, only male Hydes do. BUT the master\u2019s control seems optional because Tyler kills Laurel and fights his own mother, AND male Hydes supposedly go \u201cinsane\u201d without a master, AND they still die young because each transformation shortens their lifespan. It really sucks being a male hyena. I mean Hyde.\n\nSo\u2026 what does a \u201cmaster\u201d even mean anymore?\n\nIt just feels *messy.* I wish they had stuck closer to the original Jekyll-and-Hyde idea rather than constantly adding plot-convenient rules that contradict earlier ones. And it\u2019s not just Hydes. The Alpha werewolf lore is equally vague and inconsistent.\n\nSeason 3 is going to expand the Hyde/werewolf lore even more with Capri and her mix of Hydes and werewolves, and honestly? I\u2019m scared that by the end of it, things are going to be even more convoluted than they already are, when they really don\u2019t need to be.\n\nAlso, as I was finishing typing all of this, I remembered that in Season 1, Xavier had some weird psychic connection to Tyler/Hyde, which the show never explained. But I guess we\u2019re never going to learn how or why that worked. Oh well\u2026\n\nJust some of my thoughts. What do you guys think about Hydes and how the show handles their lore?", "timestamp": 1763745525, "label": "1"}

{"original_topic": "wednesday", "comment": "Why Wenclair Doesn\u2019t Click for Me Anymore- as a huge fan of the ship after s1 I\u2019ve been trying really hard to figure out why Wenclair doesn\u2019t hit for me anymore, especially because I *want* to love them the way I did back in season one. I genuinely enjoyed their dynamic at first. Their contrast felt natural, their growth felt earned, and the whole \u201cOpessites attract\u201d trope actually worked really well. They had softness, tension, vulnerability, and all these tiny moments that made their connection feel warm and meaningful. I really believed in the version of them that season one was building.\n\nBut after S1, something changed for me, and it\u2019s been harder than I expected to reconnect with the ship. In season two, the relationship that hooked me just\u2026 wasn\u2019t there in the same way. They spent a lot of their scenes either arguing, miscommunicating, or being emotionally out of sync, and I never felt like the show gave them the time to rebuild or deepen the connection they started with. Even when they *did* have an emotional moment, like right before switching their bodies back, it didn\u2019t carry that same spark or weight from S1. It felt more like a leftover of what they used to be rather than a continuation of what they could\u2019ve become.\n\nI\u2019m not saying the writing was malicious or that the characters stopped caring about each other, but the shift in their dynamic made it harder for me to see the romantic potential that used to stand out so clearly. Instead of growing closer, it felt like they drifted apart, and the emotional thread between them got thinner instead of stronger. And when a ship relies heavily on chemistry, softness, and contrast, that shift really affects how you connect with it.\n\nI also want to be clear: this isn\u2019t an attack on Wenclair or the people who love it. I completely understand why the ship is meaningful to so many fans, and I think the version of Wenclair in season one was genuinely compelling. I\u2019m not trying to take that away from anyone. I\u2019m just being honest about my own experience: after S1, the show didn\u2019t give me the same feeling or energy that originally made me see their relationship in a romantic light.\n\nThe frustrating part is that I *wish* I still shipped it. I wish I could recapture that spark I felt the first time around. I wish I could go back to seeing what everyone else still sees. But the shift in how they were written in S2 changed the way I interpreted their dynamic, and no matter how much I try to get that old feeling back, I can\u2019t force it.\n\nSo this isn\u2019t a hate post, or a dismissal, or some superiority compex thing. It\u2019s just me admitting that the version of Wenclair I connected to isn\u2019t really present anymore, at least not for me. And I really wish that wasn\u2019t the case.", "timestamp": 1763745525, "label": "1"}

{"original_topic": "euphoria", "comment": "Euphoria really destroyed its potential Hey y\u2019all, so I was bored and decided to rewatch Euphoria, and dang guys season 1 is literally so peak. I really feel like Euphoria stands out from all these other high school dramas because the aesthetic and cinematography is just beautiful, not to mention that I also feel like the characters are super realistic (not so much the whole high school aspect because every one of these bitches would be dress coded in two seconds if it was the real world lol) but just the way the characters think and feel, I mean I\u2019m in college now but when season 1 first came out, I was a sophomore in high school and the characters were just so relatable to me.\n\nBut I\u2019m not gonna lie, Euphoria really just wasted away all of its potential with season 2 and how they\u2019re treating the release of season 3. First of all, season 2 was lowkey trash. There wasn\u2019t much in the way of character development or just overall storyline, and after rewatching season 2, it really just feels kind of dragged on. When the hype was going on for season 2, people treated this show like it could do no wrong and so did I, but now I really just feel like season 2 is pretty bad. Lexi\u2019s play was also so unnecessary, like I get that they were trying to show how she was coming out of her shell and stuff, but I feel like they could have done that in a much better way, we as the audience really didn\u2019t need a whole recap of the events of season 1 in a school play that would have never been allowed to exist in a real school. Outside of just the writing though, I mean these people have waited SO LONG to release the next season, it\u2019s gonna be 4 years by the time the new season comes out. I know there were unexpected deaths from the cast which is just a tragedy, but it\u2019s been so long and there\u2019s so many people missing in the show now that I feel like people aren\u2019t even excited about this show anymore, and they should lowkey just call it good, but of course they\u2019re gonna milk it financially for all that it\u2019s worth.

He went from being a selfish, jealous bully to the best goddamn babysitter on the planet! Ever since he saw the Demogorgon at the Byers house in S1, he has become such a good guy. He is fiercely protective about those he cares about, especially the younger kids, who he often has to help protect as they go through with their VERY dangerous plans to combat the Upside Down.\n\nIn S4, he tells Nancy he's been thinking about what he wants his life to look like after this is all over. He's always dreamed of having a wife and 6 kids, packing them into an RV, and driving around the country to see the Grand Canyon and other great wonders of the world. He later admits to Nancy in the Upside Down that she is the wife he's been dreaming of. He has never fully gotten over her.\n\nWhile Nancy does care about Steve a lot, she has a boyfriend despite their issues and she only sees Steve as a close friend. You can tell by the look on her face she was hoping he wouldn't say that. And not only that, but Steve's dream sounds like a nightmare for someone as driven as Nancy. To have 6 kids at that point in time, Nancy would have to be a stay at home mom. And she seems like someone who would want her own career to feel fulfilled, like becoming a journalist.\n\nSomething many fans don't realize is that Steve's dream has already come true, just not in the way he had thought. He did in fact drive around in an RV with Nancy and 6 kids to prepare to go after Vecna. That sounds like an incredible setup for an absolutely devastating death.\n\nDo you think Steve will die? Will he sacrifice himself to save one of the kids or even Nancy herself? Is Steve dying the reason why Nancy is crying and washing blood off her hands in the S5 trailer?

{"original_topic": "stranger_things", "comment": "Stranger Things had an insane first Season. Season 1 is so packed in its plotline. Like they didn't wasted a single second. Zero second of fillers and the storyline is just so packed and well paced. \n\nThe show had this perfect balance of mystery, horror, thrill and heart back then. Season 1 feels like lightning in a bottle. Small town, small cast and one central mission, find Will. The world hadn't exploded into ten different storylines yet, the tension stayed insane. \n\nThe scale being small did wonders. One missing kid. One group of boys. One grieving mom. One girl with powers. One shady lab. That\u2019s it. And somehow it felt massive because the stakes were so personal.\n\nNo matter how big the show gets, that first season is always going to feel like lightning in a bottle. It set the tone perfectly. And this is why Season 2 is my 2nd favourite Season, it had the essence of Season 1. \n\nSeason 2 is the closest the show ever got to recapturing that formula. It felt like Hawkins wasn\u2019t drowning in plot threads unlike the later seasons. The characters were dealing with the fallout of Season 1, everyone was still connected, the tone stayed grounded, and Will\u2019s possession arc was just so damn strong.", "timestamp": 1763745525, "label": "1"}

In other words, will I be able to watch it and enjoy/understand it without first burning through the series from where I am now?\n\nI appreciate the advice while avoiding spoilers from post season 9.   I\u2019m also open to recs of other great later episodes that stand on their own, though given the time restraints I would need to be picky to weed out the lesser stuff from the great ones. \n\nAlso, one last thing; it sucks that Netflix is losing the show.  But there may be a tiny sliver of hope in that it\u2019s been reported that Netflix is privately in communication with the owners of Warner Bros, which is up for sale.   They are interested in purchasing WB, but at this current stage they\u2019re just feeling out their options versus other potential buyers to see if it\u2019s feasible not only for themselves but for WB seller.

There's this episode, Azazel feeding demon blood to six-month old Sam, the woman in white basically force-kissing and abusing Sam in the pilot, Meg possessing Sam in S2E14, Ruby exploiting him with demon blood in season 4, the two hunters literally forcing demon blood down Sam's throat while physically restraining him in S5E3, that whole Becky plot in S7E8, and more.

I actually don't disagree with everything said about Mike's \"points\". I agree with a lot of it. \n\nI think Gus had Tomas murdered or at least knew that's what the dealers would do. Think about it. Gus' big thing is that his people don't operate without his consent or knowledge. Gus liked these dealers so much, he risked his relationship with Walt to protect them. There's no way they did that without Gus having at least mild knowledge of it. I think it was a play to get Jesse killed. Jesse goes to retaliate, believing Walt wouldn't care or react or even know about it until Jesse had already gone to the dealers. They were already waiting for him, Jesse gets gunned down and Gus consoles Walt after having the dealers killed by Mike for killing Tomas and causing the situation to begin with. Now Gus has Walt, his perfect lab and no more \"junkie\". Walt knew this, he figured it out and literally told Gus that hypothetically Jesse might have believed it was Gus' doing. The show writers wouldn't have Walt say this unless they wanted us to think about it. \n\nBut does that make Walt the good guy? Or Mike? No. Mike wanted to kill Jesse for a long time. He wanted to kill Jesse just for doing drugs after his girlfriend died. Literally told Walt, \"Let me take care of it\" intending to kill Jesse at a drug house when he was consumed with grief. The same Mike that we're supposed to believe saw Jesse as a son. \n\nOn the flip side, Mike figured Walt out and knew exactly what kind of man Walt was. Walt isn't a saint. He kept Jesse alive for his own selfish reasons. He used Jesse, manipulated him, took advantage of him. And let's not forget... Walt caused Jane to turn over and choke and then stood there while she choked. Walt is also the reason they got mixed up with Gus to begin with. \n\nHere's the list of garbage moves Walt made that caused Jesse's life to get progressively worse at every turn: \n\n1. When they were making cash hand over fist, Walt freaked out about Skinny Pete getting mugged which is absolutely a thing that dealers have to deal with. This put Jesse in a compromising situation for a wad of cash that they could easily make back on the back end. No retaliation is bad for business? You can retaliate in other ways. Black list those \"customers\" and they'll find a way to pay you back. Like Jesse said, they had the best product and no one else was dealing because Tuco was dead. \n\n2. After Jesse gets caught up in a situation that leads to a man's death, he starts getting cocky and pushes for them to expand. He tries to act like a know it all, pulling out a map and *teaching* Jesse, the one who is in charge of business, new areas to expand to. Jesse literally warns him that going into new territory will lead to violent encounters but Walt is happy to milk the MISBELIEF that Jesse killed Spooge even though he knows Jesse and his crew are no killers. At this point, they don't even have junior dealers working for Badger, Skinny Pete or Combo. \n\n3. Every single thing that Jesse warned Walt about happens. First, Badger gets arrested which costs them $80k to resolve. This also loses them a dealer. And then, disaster: Combo gets killed. Where? In new territory where Gus' dealers are. This means they're down two dealers and only have Skinny Pete. And he naturally wants out because Combo is dead. This also puts Jesse under tremendous stress which leads to him leaning heavily into drugs. Walt starts worrying about how they're going to sell 50 pounds of product, but he doesn't seem AT ALL worried about Jesse. He finagles a deal with a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy and manages to get a deal to sell all of his product to Gus. At this point, there's no doubt that Gus is most likely buying it just to get it off the market. \n\nThe entire reason they end up in business with Gus, the entire reason Combo was killed by Gus' dealers, the entire reason this whole business deal with Gus even starts is due to **WALT'S EGO**. His ego is also what led to them having their run-in with Tuco. Walt was angry about $1500-$2000 a day being too slow for him and wanted to sell to a distributor. Walt was angry about needing pseudo for a traditional cook so he concocted the plan to steal methylamine. Out of everyone, Gus and Walt are the only ones who didn't want to \"get out\" of the business. \n\nMike was a lot of things, and up until he finally warmed up to Jesse, he was a piece of shit in a lot of ways, but he wasn't in the business to be in the business. He was happy to get out ahead at various points in the series. Him and Jesse were willing to walk away, sell their shares of the methylamine and walk away with more money than they could've earned in a lifetime. But who wanted to stay? Walt. \n\nIt's easy to see Walt as the reasonable one who wanted to help Jesse. But it's important to understand that almost every time Walt \"saved\" Jesse, he was saving Jesse from a horrible situation that **he himself** put Jesse in.", "timestamp": 1763745526, "label": "0"}

I remember in high school when Tumblr was huge how big the show was and how much hype was behind it. I'm not really a huge tv person nor do I usually give into the hype of things but a few months ago I was looking up \"best television series of all time\" and of course Breaking Bad was consistently mentioned as being #1. I'm so happy I finally got around to watching the series, I'm just sad that I'm so late. The entire cast was phenomenal, every episode from the very first one pulled me into and kept me surprised, entertained and yet astonished at how beautifully it was shot. I can't even explain how incredible this show is. I hope Vince or Bryan or Aaron write a novel about the experience of it all some day.

{"original_topic": "breaking_bad", "comment": "Majority of the show happened in 1 year - and that's actually pretty realistic As most fans have figured that the majority of Breaking Bad happened in 2 years - with one year covering the first 4 seasons and first 3 episodes of season 5 and the remaining year was 13 episodes - some have said that this timeline is ridiculously unrealistic, but IMO it makes total sense, especially during binge watches. \n\nFrom my real life experiences, a lot can happen in one year, and sometimes 3-4 years and nothing changes besides that your best friend broke up with his girlfriend or your local Los Pollos joint gets shut down. It's all relative and based on perspectives. The same way people didn't know that the Beatles' discography only lasted about 7 years, because each album/image of the band was so different from one another.\n\n Breaking Bad happens to have a lot of events and multiple perspectives told through a lot of characters (who evolve a lot throughout the course of the series) with depths to them.

The way they handled Emori's death was sweet, and I understand that Murphy had to pay some sort of a price for his horrible mistakes.  Clarke's arc seems about right...

{"original_topic": "adolescence", "comment": "Need advice about a boy at my school Hi,\n\nI\u2019m a 14-year-old girl, and I\u2019m new at my school. For a while now, I\u2019ve noticed that a boy in my class behaves in a certain way towards me, and I\u2019m not sure how to interpret it. Here are the facts:\n\n1. **At the beginning of the school year**, he often tried to make eye contact with me. I\u2019m very shy, so I avoided it. Then, he started calling me *Baka* (a Japanese word for \"idiot\") discreetly, but I could clearly hear him.\n2. **As time went on, his behavior changed**. During a school trip, on the bus, he suddenly said: *\"Wesh \\[my name\\], how are you!?\"* Then, he kept looking at me. Every time I looked at him, he would look away, and when I turned back to the window, he would look at me again. This went on for a while until I got too embarrassed and turned completely away.\n3. **One day in class**, I was talking to his little sister (we\u2019ve become friends) a bit away from the group. When we decided to rejoin the others, he suddenly rushed towards my friend, stopped abruptly when he saw me, and then went back to his friends.\n4. **His little sister told me things about him**. She said he talked about me at home, saying that at the beginning of the year, he had certain thoughts about me, but now it\u2019s better. He also said that I was nice and that I didn\u2019t talk to boys, which made me a \"good Muslim.\" He asked her not to tell me, but of course, she did.\n5. **One day, he asked if I was Moroccan**. I replied a bit curtly (I regret it). My friend later told me that before I arrived, he was talking to his friend about wanting to focus on his projects, but as soon as I walked in, he asked me that question.\n6. **Recently, while I was handing out papers in class**, he suddenly turned towards me and whispered something to his friend.\n7. **Another time, he asked me:** *\"Are you going to defend me at the class council?\"* (I\u2019m just an eco-delegate and not involved in the class council). Right after asking, he left without waiting for an answer.\n\nI\u2019m confused. He seems comfortable talking to other girls, but with me, he acts distant and ambiguous. Do you think he might be interested in me, or am I reading too much into this? How should I react?\n\nThank you in advance for your advice!\n\nAsk me questions if some points are not clear :)", "timestamp": 1763745527, "label": "0"}

Even if she underwent a lot of issues with her parents and Billy but she was so mean with Lucas when he tried to tell her about the Upside Down. I get that not everyone would believe such a story and it sounded stupid something as the Upside Down exists and Will's issue, etc but still - Lucas had to keep proving himself to her all the time. \n\n\n\nThen he kept calling out Dustin about Suzie and even made his friends give up on him, pretending she knows everything again.\n\n  \nThen she influenced El - though she was right that El should have her own life and needn't do everything Mike said but she like kept telling El to dump Mike and doing stuff that made Mike and El distance themselves, it felt wrong. She was always with an attitude over everything in all seasons. \n\n\n\nThen in season 4 she just ignores everyone. I get that she feels wrong Billy died and she could not do anything about it or even wished for him to die but others too went through a lot but they did not treat people who were there for them or 'friends' as strangers or not being there for them.

{"original_topic": "stranger_things", "comment": "Day 120 - Countdown to Stranger Things Season 5 || Steve Theory Steve \"The Hair\" Harrington has had the best redemption arc I have ever seen. He went from being a selfish, jealous bully to the best goddamn babysitter on the planet! Ever since he saw the Demogorgon at the Byers house in S1, he has become such a good guy. He is fiercely protective about those he cares about, especially the younger kids, who he often has to help protect as they go through with their VERY dangerous plans to combat the Upside Down.\n\nIn S4, he tells Nancy he's been thinking about what he wants his life to look like after this is all over. He's always dreamed of having a wife and 6 kids, packing them into an RV, and driving around the country to see the Grand Canyon and other great wonders of the world. He later admits to Nancy in the Upside Down that she is the wife he's been dreaming of. He has never fully gotten over her.\n\nWhile Nancy does care about Steve a lot, she has a boyfriend despite their issues and she only sees Steve as a close friend. You can tell by the look on her face she was hoping he wouldn't say that. And not only that, but Steve's dream sounds like a nightmare for someone as driven as Nancy. To have 6 kids at that point in time, Nancy would have to be a stay at home mom. And she seems like someone who would want her own career to feel fulfilled, like becoming a journalist.\n\nSomething many fans don't realize is that Steve's dream has already come true, just not in the way he had thought. He did in fact drive around in an RV with Nancy and 6 kids to prepare to go after Vecna. That sounds like an incredible setup for an absolutely devastating death.\n\nDo you think Steve will die? Will he sacrifice himself to save one of the kids or even Nancy herself? Is Steve dying the reason why Nancy is crying and washing blood off her hands in the S5 trailer? I know most fans would be heartbroken over this and I do not want it to happen, but it seems probable that it could happen.", "timestamp": 1763745673, "label": "1"}

{"original_topic": "supernatural", "comment": "Chronologically Sound? So I think most of you are aware that the show is scheduled to leave Netflix altogether in roughly a month.  \n\nI am running through the series, but I started about three months ago and am currently at the midway point of season 9.  What I want to ask you guys is, I won\u2019t be able to finish the series in the time left mostly because I have a life and would need to watch multiple hours per day to finish it.  But I have heard about two episodes that not only sound super interesting, but also get great IMDb ratings that I\u2019m really interested in watching:  \u201cScoobynatural\u201c and \u201cBaby.\u201d  Can I watch those right now, or at least very soon, and not be spoiling anything?  In other words, will I be able to watch it and enjoy/understand it without first burning through the series from where I am now?\n\nI appreciate the advice while avoiding spoilers from post season 9.   I\u2019m also open to recs of other great later episodes that stand on their own, though given the time restraints I would need to be picky to weed out the lesser stuff from the great ones. \n\nAlso, one last thing; it sucks that Netflix is losing the show.  But there may be a tiny sliver of hope in that it\u2019s been reported that Netflix is privately in communication with the owners of Warner Bros, which is up for sale.   They are interested in purchasing WB, but at this current stage they\u2019re just feeling out their options versus other potential buyers to see if it\u2019s feasible not only for themselves but for WB seller.  And of course, if they can purchase WB they would be outright getting the rights for Supernatural amongst their entire vast catalogue.  It probably won\u2019t happen soon, but it could still happen.

There's this episode, Azazel feeding demon blood to six-month old Sam, the woman in white basically force-kissing and abusing Sam in the pilot, Meg possessing Sam in S2E14, Ruby exploiting him with demon blood in season 4, the two hunters literally forcing demon blood down Sam's throat while physically restraining him in S5E3, that whole Becky plot in S7E8, and more.

{"original_topic": "wednesday", "comment": "I really wish Tyler and the other Hydes were written more like actual Jekyll-and-Hyde monsters Basically, exactly what the title says. A lot of the writing in this show is\u2026 let\u2019s call it \u201cwonky,\u201d and the show's lore suffers from it. The Alpha werewolf lore feels like it was made up in 5 minutes, and the Hyde lore isn\u2019t much better. The show dedicated two seasons to Hydes, and it still feels all over the place.\n\nHydes are clearly inspired by Robert Louis Stevenson's novella *The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde*. In the novella, Dr. Henry Jekyll develops a potion to separate his good and evil sides. When he drinks it, he transforms into evil Edward Hyde. Over time, Jekyll's transformations become more frequent and involuntary. The novella ends with Jekyll's final, unchangeable transformation into Hyde, who then commits suicide.\u00a0Throughout the story, Jekyll remembers everything he does as Hyde. Hyde is not a separate personality that takes over Jekyll's consciousness; rather, Hyde is Jekyll acting without his usual inhibitions, and Jekyll is fully aware of Hyde's actions. Essentially,\u00a0Jekyll tries to use the transformation to indulge in his darker impulses.\n\nThat\u2019s a very cool concept. And in Season 1, it seemed like the show was going in that direction. Tyler\u2019s first transformations are triggered by Laurel\u2019s chemicals. Maybe not at first, but over time, he becomes fully aware of his actions as a Hyde and starts enjoying them, because they give him the freedom to act on impulses he normally suppresses. That tracks with the original novella. But then the show adds lore that honestly makes everything messier: the **\u201cmaster\u201d**.\n\nAt first, I get it; writers needed a way to justify Laurel controlling Tyler and tie the twist together. Fine. But Season 2 introduces Tyler\u2019s mother, and suddenly the whole \u201cmaster\u201d concept becomes a narrative roadblock. So now apparently female Hydes don\u2019t need a master, only male Hydes do. BUT the master\u2019s control seems optional because Tyler kills Laurel and fights his own mother, AND male Hydes supposedly go \u201cinsane\u201d without a master, AND they still die young because each transformation shortens their lifespan. It really sucks being a male hyena. I mean Hyde.\n\nSo\u2026 what does a \u201cmaster\u201d even mean anymore?\n\nIt just feels *messy.* I wish they had stuck closer to the original Jekyll-and-Hyde idea rather than constantly adding plot-convenient rules that contradict earlier ones. And it\u2019s not just Hydes. The Alpha werewolf lore is equally vague and inconsistent.\n\nSeason 3 is going to expand the Hyde/werewolf lore even more with Capri and her mix of Hydes and werewolves, and honestly? I\u2019m scared that by the end of it, things are going to be even more convoluted than they already are, when they really don\u2019t need to be.\n\nAlso, as I was finishing typing all of this, I remembered that in Season 1, Xavier had some weird psychic connection to Tyler/Hyde, which the show never explained. But I guess we\u2019re never going to learn how or why that worked. Oh well\u2026\n\nJust some of my thoughts. What do you guys think about Hydes and how the show handles their lore?", "timestamp": 1763745675, "label": "1"}

{"original_topic": "wednesday", "comment": "Why Wenclair Doesn\u2019t Click for Me Anymore- as a huge fan of the ship after s1 I\u2019ve been trying really hard to figure out why Wenclair doesn\u2019t hit for me anymore, especially because I *want* to love them the way I did back in season one. I genuinely enjoyed their dynamic at first. Their contrast felt natural, their growth felt earned, and the whole \u201cOpessites attract\u201d trope actually worked really well. They had softness, tension, vulnerability, and all these tiny moments that made their connection feel warm and meaningful. I really believed in the version of them that season one was building.\n\nBut after S1, something changed for me, and it\u2019s been harder than I expected to reconnect with the ship. In season two, the relationship that hooked me just\u2026 wasn\u2019t there in the same way. They spent a lot of their scenes either arguing, miscommunicating, or being emotionally out of sync, and I never felt like the show gave them the time to rebuild or deepen the connection they started with. Even when they *did* have an emotional moment, like right before switching their bodies back, it didn\u2019t carry that same spark or weight from S1. It felt more like a leftover of what they used to be rather than a continuation of what they could\u2019ve become.\n\nI\u2019m not saying the writing was malicious or that the characters stopped caring about each other, but the shift in their dynamic made it harder for me to see the romantic potential that used to stand out so clearly. Instead of growing closer, it felt like they drifted apart, and the emotional thread between them got thinner instead of stronger. And when a ship relies heavily on chemistry, softness, and contrast, that shift really affects how you connect with it.\n\nI also want to be clear: this isn\u2019t an attack on Wenclair or the people who love it. I completely understand why the ship is meaningful to so many fans, and I think the version of Wenclair in season one was genuinely compelling. I\u2019m not trying to take that away from anyone. I\u2019m just being honest about my own experience: after S1, the show didn\u2019t give me the same feeling or energy that originally made me see their relationship in a romantic light.\n\nThe frustrating part is that I *wish* I still shipped it. I wish I could recapture that spark I felt the first time around. I wish I could go back to seeing what everyone else still sees. But the shift in how they were written in S2 changed the way I interpreted their dynamic, and no matter how much I try to get that old feeling back, I can\u2019t force it.\n\nSo this isn\u2019t a hate post, or a dismissal, or some superiority compex thing. It\u2019s just me admitting that the version of Wenclair I connected to isn\u2019t really present anymore, at least not for me. And I really wish that wasn\u2019t the case.", "timestamp": 1763745675, "label": "1"}

{"original_topic": "adolescence", "comment": "Need advice about a boy at my school Hi,\n\nI\u2019m a 14-year-old girl, and I\u2019m new at my school. For a while now, I\u2019ve noticed that a boy in my class behaves in a certain way towards me, and I\u2019m not sure how to interpret it. Here are the facts:\n\n1. **At the beginning of the school year**, he often tried to make eye contact with me. I\u2019m very shy, so I avoided it. Then, he started calling me *Baka* (a Japanese word for \"idiot\") discreetly, but I could clearly hear him.\n2. **As time went on, his behavior changed**. During a school trip, on the bus, he suddenly said: *\"Wesh \\[my name\\], how are you!?\"* Then, he kept looking at me. Every time I looked at him, he would look away, and when I turned back to the window, he would look at me again. This went on for a while until I got too embarrassed and turned completely away.\n3. **One day in class**, I was talking to his little sister (we\u2019ve become friends) a bit away from the group. When we decided to rejoin the others, he suddenly rushed towards my friend, stopped abruptly when he saw me, and then went back to his friends.\n4. **His little sister told me things about him**. She said he talked about me at home, saying that at the beginning of the year, he had certain thoughts about me, but now it\u2019s better. He also said that I was nice and that I didn\u2019t talk to boys, which made me a \"good Muslim.\" He asked her not to tell me, but of course, she did.\n5. **One day, he asked if I was Moroccan**. I replied a bit curtly (I regret it). My friend later told me that before I arrived, he was talking to his friend about wanting to focus on his projects, but as soon as I walked in, he asked me that question.\n6. **Recently, while I was handing out papers in class**, he suddenly turned towards me and whispered something to his friend.\n7. **Another time, he asked me:** *\"Are you going to defend me at the class council?\"* (I\u2019m just an eco-delegate and not involved in the class council). Right after asking, he left without waiting for an answer.\n\nI\u2019m confused. He seems comfortable talking to other girls, but with me, he acts distant and ambiguous. Do you think he might be interested in me, or am I reading too much into this? How should I react?\n\nThank you in advance for your advice!\n\nAsk me questions if some points are not clear :)", "timestamp": 1763745675, "label": "0"}

{"original_topic": "breaking_bad", "comment": "Daily reminder that neither Mike nor Walt were \"right\" or \"wrong\", they were both pretty terrible people I saw a post yesterday about how Mike was wrong in his argument against Walt about how they had a good thing and Walt blew it up. I actually don't disagree with everything said about Mike's \"points\". I agree with a lot of it. \n\nI think Gus had Tomas murdered or at least knew that's what the dealers would do. Think about it. Gus' big thing is that his people don't operate without his consent or knowledge. Gus liked these dealers so much, he risked his relationship with Walt to protect them. There's no way they did that without Gus having at least mild knowledge of it. I think it was a play to get Jesse killed. Jesse goes to retaliate, believing Walt wouldn't care or react or even know about it until Jesse had already gone to the dealers. They were already waiting for him, Jesse gets gunned down and Gus consoles Walt after having the dealers killed by Mike for killing Tomas and causing the situation to begin with. Now Gus has Walt, his perfect lab and no more \"junkie\". Walt knew this, he figured it out and literally told Gus that hypothetically Jesse might have believed it was Gus' doing. The show writers wouldn't have Walt say this unless they wanted us to think about it. \n\nBut does that make Walt the good guy? Or Mike? No. Mike wanted to kill Jesse for a long time. He wanted to kill Jesse just for doing drugs after his girlfriend died. Literally told Walt, \"Let me take care of it\" intending to kill Jesse at a drug house when he was consumed with grief. The same Mike that we're supposed to believe saw Jesse as a son. \n\nOn the flip side, Mike figured Walt out and knew exactly what kind of man Walt was. Walt isn't a saint. He kept Jesse alive for his own selfish reasons. He used Jesse, manipulated him, took advantage of him. And let's not forget... Walt caused Jane to turn over and choke and then stood there while she choked. Walt is also the reason they got mixed up with Gus to begin with. \n\nHere's the list of garbage moves Walt made that caused Jesse's life to get progressively worse at every turn: \n\n1. When they were making cash hand over fist, Walt freaked out about Skinny Pete getting mugged which is absolutely a thing that dealers have to deal with. This put Jesse in a compromising situation for a wad of cash that they could easily make back on the back end. No retaliation is bad for business? You can retaliate in other ways. Black list those \"customers\" and they'll find a way to pay you back. Like Jesse said, they had the best product and no one else was dealing because Tuco was dead. \n\n2. After Jesse gets caught up in a situation that leads to a man's death, he starts getting cocky and pushes for them to expand. He tries to act like a know it all, pulling out a map and *teaching* Jesse, the one who is in charge of business, new areas to expand to. Jesse literally warns him that going into new territory will lead to violent encounters but Walt is happy to milk the MISBELIEF that Jesse killed Spooge even though he knows Jesse and his crew are no killers. At this point, they don't even have junior dealers working for Badger, Skinny Pete or Combo. \n\n3. Every single thing that Jesse warned Walt about happens. First, Badger gets arrested which costs them $80k to resolve. This also loses them a dealer. And then, disaster: Combo gets killed. Where? In new territory where Gus' dealers are. This means they're down two dealers and only have Skinny Pete. And he naturally wants out because Combo is dead. This also puts Jesse under tremendous stress which leads to him leaning heavily into drugs. Walt starts worrying about how they're going to sell 50 pounds of product, but he doesn't seem AT ALL worried about Jesse. He finagles a deal with a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy and manages to get a deal to sell all of his product to Gus. At this point, there's no doubt that Gus is most likely buying it just to get it off the market. \n\nThe entire reason they end up in business with Gus, the entire reason Combo was killed by Gus' dealers, the entire reason this whole business deal with Gus even starts is due to **WALT'S EGO**. His ego is also what led to them having their run-in with Tuco. Walt was angry about $1500-$2000 a day being too slow for him and wanted to sell to a distributor. Walt was angry about needing pseudo for a traditional cook so he concocted the plan to steal methylamine. Out of everyone, Gus and Walt are the only ones who didn't want to \"get out\" of the business. \n\nMike was a lot of things, and up until he finally warmed up to Jesse, he was a piece of shit in a lot of ways, but he wasn't in the business to be in the business. He was happy to get out ahead at various points in the series. Him and Jesse were willing to walk away, sell their shares of the methylamine and walk away with more money than they could've earned in a lifetime. But who wanted to stay? Walt. \n\nIt's easy to see Walt as the reasonable one who wanted to help Jesse. But it's important to understand that almost every time Walt \"saved\" Jesse, he was saving Jesse from a horrible situation that **he himself** put Jesse in.", "timestamp": 1763745675, "label": "0"}

I remember in high school when Tumblr was huge how big the show was and how much hype was behind it. I'm not really a huge tv person nor do I usually give into the hype of things but a few months ago I was looking up \"best television series of all time\" and of course Breaking Bad was consistently mentioned as being #1.

The entire cast was phenomenal, every episode from the very first one pulled me into and kept me surprised, entertained and yet astonished at how beautifully it was shot. I can't even explain how incredible this show is. I hope Vince or Bryan or Aaron write a novel about the experience of it all some day.

I\u2019ve been rewatching Breaking Bad and noticed how often characters openly discuss criminal details over the phone: deals, locations, threats, everything.\n\nGiven the scale of the investigation (DEA, Hank, cartel attention, etc.), wouldn\u2019t phone tapping or surveillance have been a standard procedure at some point? Even Hank or Gomez mentioned something about tapped phones. It feels like this should\u2019ve led to several characters getting caught much earlier.\n\nAm I missing something in the show\u2019s logic, or is this actually a plot hole?\n\nEven more, how the raid of Los Pollos Hermanos trucks didn\u2019t get attention from DEA?

{"original_topic": "breaking_bad", "comment": "Majority of the show happened in 1 year - and that's actually pretty realistic As most fans have figured that the majority of Breaking Bad happened in 2 years - with one year covering the first 4 seasons and first 3 episodes of season 5 and the remaining year was 13 episodes - some have said that this timeline is ridiculously unrealistic, but IMO it makes total sense, especially during binge watches. \n\nFrom my real life experiences, a lot can happen in one year, and sometimes 3-4 years and nothing changes besides that your best friend broke up with his girlfriend or your local Los Pollos joint gets shut down. It's all relative and based on perspectives. The same way people didn't know that the Beatles' discography only lasted about 7 years, because each album/image of the band was so different from one another.\n\n Breaking Bad happens to have a lot of events and multiple perspectives told through a lot of characters (who evolve a lot throughout the course of the series) with depths to them. That gives us the illusion that the show would be like 3-4 years in total.", "timestamp": 1763745675, "label": "1"}

{"original_topic": "euphoria", "comment": "Euphoria really destroyed its potential Hey y\u2019all, so I was bored and decided to rewatch Euphoria, and dang guys season 1 is literally so peak. I really feel like Euphoria stands out from all these other high school dramas because the aesthetic and cinematography is just beautiful, not to mention that I also feel like the characters are super realistic (not so much the whole high school aspect because every one of these bitches would be dress coded in two seconds if it was the real world lol) but just the way the characters think and feel, I mean I\u2019m in college now but when season 1 first came out, I was a sophomore in high school and the characters were just so relatable to me.\n\nBut I\u2019m not gonna lie, Euphoria really just wasted away all of its potential with season 2 and how they\u2019re treating the release of season 3. First of all, season 2 was lowkey trash. There wasn\u2019t much in the way of character development or just overall storyline, and after rewatching season 2, it really just feels kind of dragged on. When the hype was going on for season 2, people treated this show like it could do no wrong and so did I, but now I really just feel like season 2 is pretty bad. Lexi\u2019s play was also so unnecessary, like I get that they were trying to show how she was coming out of her shell and stuff, but I feel like they could have done that in a much better way, we as the audience really didn\u2019t need a whole recap of the events of season 1 in a school play that would have never been allowed to exist in a real school. Outside of just the writing though, I mean these people have waited SO LONG to release the next season, it\u2019s gonna be 4 years by the time the new season comes out. I know there were unexpected deaths from the cast which is just a tragedy, but it\u2019s been so long and there\u2019s so many people missing in the show now that I feel like people aren\u2019t even excited about this show anymore, and they should lowkey just call it good, but of course they\u2019re gonna milk it financially for all that it\u2019s worth.

I realize it is just me... but.  \n\nI really liked the story arc of Octavia and Indra, but hated the arc of Bellamy.  The way they handled Emori's death was sweet, and I understand that Murphy had to pay some sort of a price for his horrible mistakes.  Clarke's arc seems about right... But I do feel that she did everything for the betterment of her friends and her people... and killing the guy in front of the judge kind of seems forced. \n\n  \nThe ending I do not like.  I do like that her core people come back to be with her... but I don't like that they are ostracized and they can't repopulate.

{"original_topic": "breaking_bad", "comment": "Daily reminder that neither Mike nor Walt were \"right\" or \"wrong\", they were both pretty terrible people I saw a post yesterday about how Mike was wrong in his argument against Walt about how they had a good thing and Walt blew it up. I actually don't disagree with everything said about Mike's \"points\". I agree with a lot of it. \n\nI think Gus had Tomas murdered or at least knew that's what the dealers would do. Think about it. Gus' big thing is that his people don't operate without his consent or knowledge. Gus liked these dealers so much, he risked his relationship with Walt to protect them. There's no way they did that without Gus having at least mild knowledge of it. I think it was a play to get Jesse killed. Jesse goes to retaliate, believing Walt wouldn't care or react or even know about it until Jesse had already gone to the dealers. They were already waiting for him, Jesse gets gunned down and Gus consoles Walt after having the dealers killed by Mike for killing Tomas and causing the situation to begin with. Now Gus has Walt, his perfect lab and no more \"junkie\". Walt knew this, he figured it out and literally told Gus that hypothetically Jesse might have believed it was Gus' doing. The show writers wouldn't have Walt say this unless they wanted us to think about it. \n\nBut does that make Walt the good guy? Or Mike? No. Mike wanted to kill Jesse for a long time. He wanted to kill Jesse just for doing drugs after his girlfriend died. Literally told Walt, \"Let me take care of it\" intending to kill Jesse at a drug house when he was consumed with grief. The same Mike that we're supposed to believe saw Jesse as a son. \n\nOn the flip side, Mike figured Walt out and knew exactly what kind of man Walt was. Walt isn't a saint. He kept Jesse alive for his own selfish reasons. He used Jesse, manipulated him, took advantage of him. And let's not forget... Walt caused Jane to turn over and choke and then stood there while she choked. Walt is also the reason they got mixed up with Gus to begin with. \n\nHere's the list of garbage moves Walt made that caused Jesse's life to get progressively worse at every turn: \n\n1. When they were making cash hand over fist, Walt freaked out about Skinny Pete getting mugged which is absolutely a thing that dealers have to deal with. This put Jesse in a compromising situation for a wad of cash that they could easily make back on the back end. No retaliation is bad for business? You can retaliate in other ways. Black list those \"customers\" and they'll find a way to pay you back. Like Jesse said, they had the best product and no one else was dealing because Tuco was dead. \n\n2. After Jesse gets caught up in a situation that leads to a man's death, he starts getting cocky and pushes for them to expand. He tries to act like a know it all, pulling out a map and *teaching* Jesse, the one who is in charge of business, new areas to expand to. Jesse literally warns him that going into new territory will lead to violent encounters but Walt is happy to milk the MISBELIEF that Jesse killed Spooge even though he knows Jesse and his crew are no killers. At this point, they don't even have junior dealers working for Badger, Skinny Pete or Combo. \n\n3. Every single thing that Jesse warned Walt about happens. First, Badger gets arrested which costs them $80k to resolve. This also loses them a dealer. And then, disaster: Combo gets killed. Where? In new territory where Gus' dealers are. This means they're down two dealers and only have Skinny Pete. And he naturally wants out because Combo is dead. This also puts Jesse under tremendous stress which leads to him leaning heavily into drugs. Walt starts worrying about how they're going to sell 50 pounds of product, but he doesn't seem AT ALL worried about Jesse. He finagles a deal with a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy and manages to get a deal to sell all of his product to Gus. At this point, there's no doubt that Gus is most likely buying it just to get it off the market. \n\nThe entire reason they end up in business with Gus, the entire reason Combo was killed by Gus' dealers, the entire reason this whole business deal with Gus even starts is due to **WALT'S EGO**. His ego is also what led to them having their run-in with Tuco. Walt was angry about $1500-$2000 a day being too slow for him and wanted to sell to a distributor. Walt was angry about needing pseudo for a traditional cook so he concocted the plan to steal methylamine. Out of everyone, Gus and Walt are the only ones who didn't want to \"get out\" of the business. \n\nMike was a lot of things, and up until he finally warmed up to Jesse, he was a piece of shit in a lot of ways, but he wasn't in the business to be in the business. He was happy to get out ahead at various points in the series. Him and Jesse were willing to walk away, sell their shares of the methylamine and walk away with more money than they could've earned in a lifetime. But who wanted to stay? Walt. \n\nIt's easy to see Walt as the reasonable one who wanted to help Jesse. But it's important to understand that almost every time Walt \"saved\" Jesse, he was saving Jesse from a horrible situation that **he himself** put Jesse in.", "timestamp": 1763747887, "label": "0"}

It's all relative and based on perspectives. The same way people didn't know that the Beatles' discography only lasted about 7 years, because each album/image of the band was so different from one another.\n\n Breaking Bad happens to have a lot of events and multiple perspectives told through a lot of characters (who evolve a lot throughout the course of the series) with depths to them.

For a while now, I\u2019ve noticed that a boy in my class behaves in a certain way towards me, and I\u2019m not sure how to interpret it. Here are the facts:\n\n1. **At the beginning of the school year**, he often tried to make eye contact with me. I\u2019m very shy, so I avoided it. Then, he started calling me *Baka* (a Japanese word for \"idiot\") discreetly, but I could clearly hear him.\n2. **As time went on, his behavior changed**. During a school trip, on the bus, he suddenly said: *\"Wesh \\[my name\\], how are you!?\"* Then, he kept looking at me. Every time I looked at him, he would look away, and when I turned back to the window, he would look at me again. This went on for a while until I got too embarrassed and turned completely away.\n3. **One day in class**, I was talking to his little sister (we\u2019ve become friends) a bit away from the group. When we decided to rejoin the others, he suddenly rushed towards my friend, stopped abruptly when he saw me, and then went back to his friends.\n4. **His little sister told me things about him**. She said he talked about me at home, saying that at the beginning of the year, he had certain thoughts about me, but now it\u2019s better. He also said that I was nice and that I didn\u2019t talk to boys, which made me a \"good Muslim.\" He asked her not to tell me, but of course, she did.\n5. **One day, he asked if I was Moroccan**. I replied a bit curtly (I regret it). My friend later told me that before I arrived, he was talking to his friend about wanting to focus on his projects, but as soon as I walked in, he asked me that question.\n6. **Recently, while I was handing out papers in class**, he suddenly turned towards me and whispered something to his friend.\n7. **Another time, he asked me:** *\"Are you going to defend me at the class council?\"* (I\u2019m just an eco-delegate and not involved in the class council). Right after asking, he left without waiting for an answer.\n\nI\u2019m confused. He seems comfortable talking to other girls, but with me, he acts distant and ambiguous. Do you think he might be interested in me, or am I reading too much into this? How should I react?\n\nThank you in advance for your advice!\n\nAsk me questions if some points are not clear :)", "timestamp": 1763747896, "label": "0"}

I\u2019m also open to recs of other great later episodes that stand on their own, though given the time restraints I would need to be picky to weed out the lesser stuff from the great ones. \n\nAlso, one last thing; it sucks that Netflix is losing the show.

This is season 5 episode 12 \"Swap Meat\" where this teenage boy basically used his abilities to switch bodies with Sam. I get this was supposed to be some unusual thing they haven't really experienced before, but the amount of times throughout this show when Sam's own body gets taken advantage of or violated is very unsettling. There's this episode, Azazel feeding demon blood to six-month old Sam, the woman in white basically force-kissing and abusing Sam in the pilot, Meg possessing Sam in S2E14, Ruby exploiting him with demon blood in season 4, the two hunters literally forcing demon blood down Sam's throat while physically restraining him in S5E3, that whole Becky plot in S7E8, and more. Why did the writers have Sam being constantly violated and taken advantage of and being the bigger punching bag and using them for laughs and humor? And yes, I know this show ended years ago, but still!!!!!", "timestamp": 1763747899, "label": "0"}

Yet he gets blamed for it for seasons, as if he had any control over what was done to him.\n\nWhen he killed Lilith, everyone treated it like the right move\u2026 until the fallout came, and suddenly it was all on him again.\n\nThen he literally throws himself into the Cage to stop Lucifer. He saves the world in the most brutal way possible. But instead of people acknowledging that sacrifice, the focus becomes how \u201csoulless\u201d he was afterward, like that was some moral failing on his part.\n\nSeason 10 hits it even harder. Sam does everything he can to save Dean from the Mark and from being a demon. He stretches himself thin emotionally and physically, and he never once attacks Dean the way Dean attacks him. And in the finale, when Dean is ready to kill him because Death told him to, Sam accepts it. He\u2019s still loving, still gentle, still trying to reach his brother.\n\nFor a character who\u2019s constantly sacrificing himself, it\u2019s wild how rarely he gets real credit for it.", "timestamp": 1763747899, "label": "0"}

{"original_topic": "wednesday", "comment": "I really wish Tyler and the other Hydes were written more like actual Jekyll-and-Hyde monsters Basically, exactly what the title says. A lot of the writing in this show is\u2026 let\u2019s call it \u201cwonky,\u201d and the show's lore suffers from it. The Alpha werewolf lore feels like it was made up in 5 minutes, and the Hyde lore isn\u2019t much better. The show dedicated two seasons to Hydes, and it still feels all over the place.\n\nHydes are clearly inspired by Robert Louis Stevenson's novella *The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde*. In the novella, Dr. Henry Jekyll develops a potion to separate his good and evil sides. When he drinks it, he transforms into evil Edward Hyde. Over time, Jekyll's transformations become more frequent and involuntary. The novella ends with Jekyll's final, unchangeable transformation into Hyde, who then commits suicide.\u00a0Throughout the story, Jekyll remembers everything he does as Hyde. Hyde is not a separate personality that takes over Jekyll's consciousness; rather, Hyde is Jekyll acting without his usual inhibitions, and Jekyll is fully aware of Hyde's actions. Essentially,\u00a0Jekyll tries to use the transformation to indulge in his darker impulses.\n\nThat\u2019s a very cool concept. And in Season 1, it seemed like the show was going in that direction. Tyler\u2019s first transformations are triggered by Laurel\u2019s chemicals. Maybe not at first, but over time, he becomes fully aware of his actions as a Hyde and starts enjoying them, because they give him the freedom to act on impulses he normally suppresses. That tracks with the original novella. But then the show adds lore that honestly makes everything messier: the **\u201cmaster\u201d**.\n\nAt first, I get it; writers needed a way to justify Laurel controlling Tyler and tie the twist together. Fine. But Season 2 introduces Tyler\u2019s mother, and suddenly the whole \u201cmaster\u201d concept becomes a narrative roadblock. So now apparently female Hydes don\u2019t need a master, only male Hydes do. BUT the master\u2019s control seems optional because Tyler kills Laurel and fights his own mother, AND male Hydes supposedly go \u201cinsane\u201d without a master, AND they still die young because each transformation shortens their lifespan. It really sucks being a male hyena. I mean Hyde.\n\nSo\u2026 what does a \u201cmaster\u201d even mean anymore?\n\nIt just feels *messy.* I wish they had stuck closer to the original Jekyll-and-Hyde idea rather than constantly adding plot-convenient rules that contradict earlier ones. And it\u2019s not just Hydes. The Alpha werewolf lore is equally vague and inconsistent.\n\nSeason 3 is going to expand the Hyde/werewolf lore even more with Capri and her mix of Hydes and werewolves, and honestly? I\u2019m scared that by the end of it, things are going to be even more convoluted than they already are, when they really don\u2019t need to be.\n\nAlso, as I was finishing typing all of this, I remembered that in Season 1, Xavier had some weird psychic connection to Tyler/Hyde, which the show never explained. But I guess we\u2019re never going to learn how or why that worked. Oh well\u2026\n\nJust some of my thoughts. What do you guys think about Hydes and how the show handles their lore?", "timestamp": 1763747901, "label": "1"}

{"original_topic": "wednesday", "comment": "Why Wenclair Doesn\u2019t Click for Me Anymore- as a huge fan of the ship after s1 I\u2019ve been trying really hard to figure out why Wenclair doesn\u2019t hit for me anymore, especially because I *want* to love them the way I did back in season one. I genuinely enjoyed their dynamic at first. Their contrast felt natural, their growth felt earned, and the whole \u201cOpessites attract\u201d trope actually worked really well. They had softness, tension, vulnerability, and all these tiny moments that made their connection feel warm and meaningful. I really believed in the version of them that season one was building.\n\nBut after S1, something changed for me, and it\u2019s been harder than I expected to reconnect with the ship. In season two, the relationship that hooked me just\u2026 wasn\u2019t there in the same way. They spent a lot of their scenes either arguing, miscommunicating, or being emotionally out of sync, and I never felt like the show gave them the time to rebuild or deepen the connection they started with. Even when they *did* have an emotional moment, like right before switching their bodies back, it didn\u2019t carry that same spark or weight from S1. It felt more like a leftover of what they used to be rather than a continuation of what they could\u2019ve become.\n\nI\u2019m not saying the writing was malicious or that the characters stopped caring about each other, but the shift in their dynamic made it harder for me to see the romantic potential that used to stand out so clearly. Instead of growing closer, it felt like they drifted apart, and the emotional thread between them got thinner instead of stronger. And when a ship relies heavily on chemistry, softness, and contrast, that shift really affects how you connect with it.\n\nI also want to be clear: this isn\u2019t an attack on Wenclair or the people who love it. I completely understand why the ship is meaningful to so many fans, and I think the version of Wenclair in season one was genuinely compelling. I\u2019m not trying to take that away from anyone. I\u2019m just being honest about my own experience: after S1, the show didn\u2019t give me the same feeling or energy that originally made me see their relationship in a romantic light.\n\nThe frustrating part is that I *wish* I still shipped it. I wish I could recapture that spark I felt the first time around. I wish I could go back to seeing what everyone else still sees. But the shift in how they were written in S2 changed the way I interpreted their dynamic, and no matter how much I try to get that old feeling back, I can\u2019t force it.\n\nSo this isn\u2019t a hate post, or a dismissal, or some superiority compex thing. It\u2019s just me admitting that the version of Wenclair I connected to isn\u2019t really present anymore, at least not for me. And I really wish that wasn\u2019t the case.", "timestamp": 1763747903, "label": "1"}

He went from being a selfish, jealous bully to the best goddamn babysitter on the planet! Ever since he saw the Demogorgon at the Byers house in S1, he has become such a good guy. He is fiercely protective about those he cares about, especially the younger kids, who he often has to help protect as they go through with their VERY dangerous plans to combat the Upside Down.\n\nIn S4, he tells Nancy he's been thinking about what he wants his life to look like after this is all over. He's always dreamed of having a wife and 6 kids, packing them into an RV, and driving around the country to see the Grand Canyon and other great wonders of the world. He later admits to Nancy in the Upside Down that she is the wife he's been dreaming of. He has never fully gotten over her.\n\nWhile Nancy does care about Steve a lot, she has a boyfriend despite their issues and she only sees Steve as a close friend. You can tell by the look on her face she was hoping he wouldn't say that. And not only that, but Steve's dream sounds like a nightmare for someone as driven as Nancy. To have 6 kids at that point in time, Nancy would have to be a stay at home mom. And she seems like someone who would want her own career to feel fulfilled, like becoming a journalist.\n\nSomething many fans don't realize is that Steve's dream has already come true, just not in the way he had thought. He did in fact drive around in an RV with Nancy and 6 kids to prepare to go after Vecna. That sounds like an incredible setup for an absolutely devastating death.\n\nDo you think Steve will die?

{"original_topic": "stranger_things", "comment": "Stranger Things had an insane first Season. Season 1 is so packed in its plotline. Like they didn't wasted a single second. Zero second of fillers and the storyline is just so packed and well paced. \n\nThe show had this perfect balance of mystery, horror, thrill and heart back then. Season 1 feels like lightning in a bottle. Small town, small cast and one central mission, find Will. The world hadn't exploded into ten different storylines yet, the tension stayed insane. \n\nThe scale being small did wonders. One missing kid. One group of boys. One grieving mom. One girl with powers. One shady lab. That\u2019s it. And somehow it felt massive because the stakes were so personal.\n\nNo matter how big the show gets, that first season is always going to feel like lightning in a bottle. It set the tone perfectly. And this is why Season 2 is my 2nd favourite Season, it had the essence of Season 1. \n\nSeason 2 is the closest the show ever got to recapturing that formula. It felt like Hawkins wasn\u2019t drowning in plot threads unlike the later seasons. The characters were dealing with the fallout of Season 1, everyone was still connected, the tone stayed grounded, and Will\u2019s possession arc was just so damn strong.", "timestamp": 1763747906, "label": "1"}

First of all, season 2 was lowkey trash. There wasn\u2019t much in the way of character development or just overall storyline, and after rewatching season 2, it really just feels kind of dragged on. When the hype was going on for season 2, people treated this show like it could do no wrong and so did I, but now I really just feel like season 2 is pretty bad. Lexi\u2019s play was also so unnecessary, like I get that they were trying to show how she was coming out of her shell and stuff, but I feel like they could have done that in a much better way, we as the audience really didn\u2019t need a whole recap of the events of season 1 in a school play that would have never been allowed to exist in a real school. Outside of just the writing though, I mean these people have waited SO LONG to release the next season, it\u2019s gonna be 4 years by the time the new season comes out. I know there were unexpected deaths from the cast which is just a tragedy, but it\u2019s been so long and there\u2019s so many people missing in the show now that I feel like people aren\u2019t even excited about this show anymore, and they should lowkey just call it good, but of course they\u2019re gonna milk it financially for all that it\u2019s worth.

I dressed like this ever since I was a kid, before supernatural, or even before I worked the trades.\n\nClothing like this is soft, but durable. And the fabric breaths well. So even in the hot sun it's not so bad wearing layers. Keeps you from getting scratched or sunburned.

He has proven this time and time again. He let alt-Michael into himself, I think, because he was desperate to save Sam and Jack. But he had to know that the angel was not going to honor the deal and would take him over. Besides Castiel, they haven't had a whole lot of great experiences with angels. He seemed so surprised when Michael did what he did and I was just like, really? What did he expect? That Michael would just quietly leave at the end of that terrible fight (that fight being a discussion for another time). Lucifer is dead (maybe, who knows, the next seasons are all new for me), Dean is gone (I know he gets out of it because I hope they wouldn't beat this dead horse of a plotline for two more seasons), Jack is graceless and Sam is alone again.

{"original_topic": "supernatural", "comment": "Chronologically Sound? So I think most of you are aware that the show is scheduled to leave Netflix altogether in roughly a month.  \n\nI am running through the series, but I started about three months ago and am currently at the midway point of season 9.  What I want to ask you guys is, I won\u2019t be able to finish the series in the time left mostly because I have a life and would need to watch multiple hours per day to finish it.  But I have heard about two episodes that not only sound super interesting, but also get great IMDb ratings that I\u2019m really interested in watching:  \u201cScoobynatural\u201c and \u201cBaby.\u201d  Can I watch those right now, or at least very soon, and not be spoiling anything?  In other words, will I be able to watch it and enjoy/understand it without first burning through the series from where I am now?\n\nI appreciate the advice while avoiding spoilers from post season 9.   I\u2019m also open to recs of other great later episodes that stand on their own, though given the time restraints I would need to be picky to weed out the lesser stuff from the great ones. \n\nAlso, one last thing; it sucks that Netflix is losing the show.  But there may be a tiny sliver of hope in that it\u2019s been reported that Netflix is privately in communication with the owners of Warner Bros, which is up for sale.   They are interested in purchasing WB, but at this current stage they\u2019re just feeling out their options versus other potential buyers to see if it\u2019s feasible not only for themselves but for WB seller.  And of course, if they can purchase WB they would be outright getting the rights for Supernatural amongst their entire vast catalogue.  It probably won\u2019t happen soon, but it could still happen.  Something to keep an eye on.\n\nI appreciate any comments about the two episodes referenced, cheers.  \u270c\ufe0f", "timestamp": 1763748503, "label": "0"}

This is season 5 episode 12 \"Swap Meat\" where this teenage boy basically used his abilities to switch bodies with Sam. I get this was supposed to be some unusual thing they haven't really experienced before, but the amount of times throughout this show when Sam's own body gets taken advantage of or violated is very unsettling. There's this episode, Azazel feeding demon blood to six-month old Sam, the woman in white basically force-kissing and abusing Sam in the pilot, Meg possessing Sam in S2E14, Ruby exploiting him with demon blood in season 4, the two hunters literally forcing demon blood down Sam's throat while physically restraining him in S5E3, that whole Becky plot in S7E8, and more.

Sam does everything he can to save Dean from the Mark and from being a demon. He stretches himself thin emotionally and physically, and he never once attacks Dean the way Dean attacks him. And in the finale, when Dean is ready to kill him because Death told him to, Sam accepts it.

{"original_topic": "stranger_things", "comment": "Day 120 - Countdown to Stranger Things Season 5 || Steve Theory Steve \"The Hair\" Harrington has had the best redemption arc I have ever seen. He went from being a selfish, jealous bully to the best goddamn babysitter on the planet! Ever since he saw the Demogorgon at the Byers house in S1, he has become such a good guy. He is fiercely protective about those he cares about, especially the younger kids, who he often has to help protect as they go through with their VERY dangerous plans to combat the Upside Down.\n\nIn S4, he tells Nancy he's been thinking about what he wants his life to look like after this is all over. He's always dreamed of having a wife and 6 kids, packing them into an RV, and driving around the country to see the Grand Canyon and other great wonders of the world. He later admits to Nancy in the Upside Down that she is the wife he's been dreaming of. He has never fully gotten over her.\n\nWhile Nancy does care about Steve a lot, she has a boyfriend despite their issues and she only sees Steve as a close friend. You can tell by the look on her face she was hoping he wouldn't say that. And not only that, but Steve's dream sounds like a nightmare for someone as driven as Nancy. To have 6 kids at that point in time, Nancy would have to be a stay at home mom. And she seems like someone who would want her own career to feel fulfilled, like becoming a journalist.\n\nSomething many fans don't realize is that Steve's dream has already come true, just not in the way he had thought. He did in fact drive around in an RV with Nancy and 6 kids to prepare to go after Vecna. That sounds like an incredible setup for an absolutely devastating death.\n\nDo you think Steve will die? Will he sacrifice himself to save one of the kids or even Nancy herself? Is Steve dying the reason why Nancy is crying and washing blood off her hands in the S5 trailer? I know most fans would be heartbroken over this and I do not want it to happen, but it seems probable that it could happen.", "timestamp": 1763748510, "label": "1"}

{"original_topic": "stranger_things", "comment": "Stranger Things had an insane first Season. Season 1 is so packed in its plotline. Like they didn't wasted a single second. Zero second of fillers and the storyline is just so packed and well paced. \n\nThe show had this perfect balance of mystery, horror, thrill and heart back then. Season 1 feels like lightning in a bottle. Small town, small cast and one central mission, find Will. The world hadn't exploded into ten different storylines yet, the tension stayed insane. \n\nThe scale being small did wonders. One missing kid. One group of boys. One grieving mom. One girl with powers. One shady lab. That\u2019s it. And somehow it felt massive because the stakes were so personal.\n\nNo matter how big the show gets, that first season is always going to feel like lightning in a bottle. It set the tone perfectly. And this is why Season 2 is my 2nd favourite Season, it had the essence of Season 1. \n\nSeason 2 is the closest the show ever got to recapturing that formula. It felt like Hawkins wasn\u2019t drowning in plot threads unlike the later seasons. The characters were dealing with the fallout of Season 1, everyone was still connected, the tone stayed grounded, and Will\u2019s possession arc was just so damn strong.", "timestamp": 1763748512, "label": "1"}

Outside of just the writing though, I mean these people have waited SO LONG to release the next season, it\u2019s gonna be 4 years by the time the new season comes out. I know there were unexpected deaths from the cast which is just a tragedy, but it\u2019s been so long and there\u2019s so many people missing in the show now that I feel like people aren\u2019t even excited about this show anymore, and they should lowkey just call it good, but of course they\u2019re gonna milk it financially for all that it\u2019s worth.

{"original_topic": "wednesday", "comment": "I really wish Tyler and the other Hydes were written more like actual Jekyll-and-Hyde monsters Basically, exactly what the title says. A lot of the writing in this show is\u2026 let\u2019s call it \u201cwonky,\u201d and the show's lore suffers from it. The Alpha werewolf lore feels like it was made up in 5 minutes, and the Hyde lore isn\u2019t much better. The show dedicated two seasons to Hydes, and it still feels all over the place.\n\nHydes are clearly inspired by Robert Louis Stevenson's novella *The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde*. In the novella, Dr. Henry Jekyll develops a potion to separate his good and evil sides. When he drinks it, he transforms into evil Edward Hyde. Over time, Jekyll's transformations become more frequent and involuntary. The novella ends with Jekyll's final, unchangeable transformation into Hyde, who then commits suicide.\u00a0Throughout the story, Jekyll remembers everything he does as Hyde. Hyde is not a separate personality that takes over Jekyll's consciousness; rather, Hyde is Jekyll acting without his usual inhibitions, and Jekyll is fully aware of Hyde's actions. Essentially,\u00a0Jekyll tries to use the transformation to indulge in his darker impulses.\n\nThat\u2019s a very cool concept. And in Season 1, it seemed like the show was going in that direction. Tyler\u2019s first transformations are triggered by Laurel\u2019s chemicals. Maybe not at first, but over time, he becomes fully aware of his actions as a Hyde and starts enjoying them, because they give him the freedom to act on impulses he normally suppresses. That tracks with the original novella. But then the show adds lore that honestly makes everything messier: the **\u201cmaster\u201d**.\n\nAt first, I get it; writers needed a way to justify Laurel controlling Tyler and tie the twist together. Fine. But Season 2 introduces Tyler\u2019s mother, and suddenly the whole \u201cmaster\u201d concept becomes a narrative roadblock. So now apparently female Hydes don\u2019t need a master, only male Hydes do. BUT the master\u2019s control seems optional because Tyler kills Laurel and fights his own mother, AND male Hydes supposedly go \u201cinsane\u201d without a master, AND they still die young because each transformation shortens their lifespan. It really sucks being a male hyena. I mean Hyde.\n\nSo\u2026 what does a \u201cmaster\u201d even mean anymore?\n\nIt just feels *messy.* I wish they had stuck closer to the original Jekyll-and-Hyde idea rather than constantly adding plot-convenient rules that contradict earlier ones. And it\u2019s not just Hydes. The Alpha werewolf lore is equally vague and inconsistent.\n\nSeason 3 is going to expand the Hyde/werewolf lore even more with Capri and her mix of Hydes and werewolves, and honestly? I\u2019m scared that by the end of it, things are going to be even more convoluted than they already are, when they really don\u2019t need to be.\n\nAlso, as I was finishing typing all of this, I remembered that in Season 1, Xavier had some weird psychic connection to Tyler/Hyde, which the show never explained. But I guess we\u2019re never going to learn how or why that worked. Oh well\u2026\n\nJust some of my thoughts. What do you guys think about Hydes and how the show handles their lore?", "timestamp": 1763748517, "label": "1"}

{"original_topic": "wednesday", "comment": "Why Wenclair Doesn\u2019t Click for Me Anymore- as a huge fan of the ship after s1 I\u2019ve been trying really hard to figure out why Wenclair doesn\u2019t hit for me anymore, especially because I *want* to love them the way I did back in season one. I genuinely enjoyed their dynamic at first. Their contrast felt natural, their growth felt earned, and the whole \u201cOpessites attract\u201d trope actually worked really well. They had softness, tension, vulnerability, and all these tiny moments that made their connection feel warm and meaningful. I really believed in the version of them that season one was building.\n\nBut after S1, something changed for me, and it\u2019s been harder than I expected to reconnect with the ship. In season two, the relationship that hooked me just\u2026 wasn\u2019t there in the same way. They spent a lot of their scenes either arguing, miscommunicating, or being emotionally out of sync, and I never felt like the show gave them the time to rebuild or deepen the connection they started with. Even when they *did* have an emotional moment, like right before switching their bodies back, it didn\u2019t carry that same spark or weight from S1. It felt more like a leftover of what they used to be rather than a continuation of what they could\u2019ve become.\n\nI\u2019m not saying the writing was malicious or that the characters stopped caring about each other, but the shift in their dynamic made it harder for me to see the romantic potential that used to stand out so clearly. Instead of growing closer, it felt like they drifted apart, and the emotional thread between them got thinner instead of stronger. And when a ship relies heavily on chemistry, softness, and contrast, that shift really affects how you connect with it.\n\nI also want to be clear: this isn\u2019t an attack on Wenclair or the people who love it. I completely understand why the ship is meaningful to so many fans, and I think the version of Wenclair in season one was genuinely compelling. I\u2019m not trying to take that away from anyone. I\u2019m just being honest about my own experience: after S1, the show didn\u2019t give me the same feeling or energy that originally made me see their relationship in a romantic light.\n\nThe frustrating part is that I *wish* I still shipped it. I wish I could recapture that spark I felt the first time around. I wish I could go back to seeing what everyone else still sees. But the shift in how they were written in S2 changed the way I interpreted their dynamic, and no matter how much I try to get that old feeling back, I can\u2019t force it.\n\nSo this isn\u2019t a hate post, or a dismissal, or some superiority compex thing. It\u2019s just me admitting that the version of Wenclair I connected to isn\u2019t really present anymore, at least not for me. And I really wish that wasn\u2019t the case.", "timestamp": 1763748519, "label": "1"}

{"original_topic": "adolescence", "comment": "Need advice about a boy at my school Hi,\n\nI\u2019m a 14-year-old girl, and I\u2019m new at my school. For a while now, I\u2019ve noticed that a boy in my class behaves in a certain way towards me, and I\u2019m not sure how to interpret it. Here are the facts:\n\n1. **At the beginning of the school year**, he often tried to make eye contact with me. I\u2019m very shy, so I avoided it. Then, he started calling me *Baka* (a Japanese word for \"idiot\") discreetly, but I could clearly hear him.\n2. **As time went on, his behavior changed**. During a school trip, on the bus, he suddenly said: *\"Wesh \\[my name\\], how are you!?\"* Then, he kept looking at me. Every time I looked at him, he would look away, and when I turned back to the window, he would look at me again. This went on for a while until I got too embarrassed and turned completely away.\n3. **One day in class**, I was talking to his little sister (we\u2019ve become friends) a bit away from the group. When we decided to rejoin the others, he suddenly rushed towards my friend, stopped abruptly when he saw me, and then went back to his friends.\n4. **His little sister told me things about him**. She said he talked about me at home, saying that at the beginning of the year, he had certain thoughts about me, but now it\u2019s better. He also said that I was nice and that I didn\u2019t talk to boys, which made me a \"good Muslim.\" He asked her not to tell me, but of course, she did.\n5. **One day, he asked if I was Moroccan**. I replied a bit curtly (I regret it). My friend later told me that before I arrived, he was talking to his friend about wanting to focus on his projects, but as soon as I walked in, he asked me that question.\n6. **Recently, while I was handing out papers in class**, he suddenly turned towards me and whispered something to his friend.\n7. **Another time, he asked me:** *\"Are you going to defend me at the class council?\"* (I\u2019m just an eco-delegate and not involved in the class council). Right after asking, he left without waiting for an answer.\n\nI\u2019m confused. He seems comfortable talking to other girls, but with me, he acts distant and ambiguous. Do you think he might be interested in me, or am I reading too much into this? How should I react?\n\nThank you in advance for your advice!\n\nAsk me questions if some points are not clear :)", "timestamp": 1763748520, "label": "0"}

I actually don't disagree with everything said about Mike's \"points\". I agree with a lot of it. \n\nI think Gus had Tomas murdered or at least knew that's what the dealers would do. Think about it. Gus' big thing is that his people don't operate without his consent or knowledge. Gus liked these dealers so much, he risked his relationship with Walt to protect them. There's no way they did that without Gus having at least mild knowledge of it. I think it was a play to get Jesse killed. Jesse goes to retaliate, believing Walt wouldn't care or react or even know about it until Jesse had already gone to the dealers. They were already waiting for him, Jesse gets gunned down and Gus consoles Walt after having the dealers killed by Mike for killing Tomas and causing the situation to begin with. Now Gus has Walt, his perfect lab and no more \"junkie\". Walt knew this, he figured it out and literally told Gus that hypothetically Jesse might have believed it was Gus' doing. The show writers wouldn't have Walt say this unless they wanted us to think about it. \n\nBut does that make Walt the good guy? Or Mike? No. Mike wanted to kill Jesse for a long time. He wanted to kill Jesse just for doing drugs after his girlfriend died. Literally told Walt, \"Let me take care of it\" intending to kill Jesse at a drug house when he was consumed with grief. The same Mike that we're supposed to believe saw Jesse as a son. \n\nOn the flip side, Mike figured Walt out and knew exactly what kind of man Walt was. Walt isn't a saint. He kept Jesse alive for his own selfish reasons. He used Jesse, manipulated him, took advantage of him. And let's not forget... Walt caused Jane to turn over and choke and then stood there while she choked. Walt is also the reason they got mixed up with Gus to begin with. \n\nHere's the list of garbage moves Walt made that caused Jesse's life to get progressively worse at every turn: \n\n1. When they were making cash hand over fist, Walt freaked out about Skinny Pete getting mugged which is absolutely a thing that dealers have to deal with. This put Jesse in a compromising situation for a wad of cash that they could easily make back on the back end. No retaliation is bad for business? You can retaliate in other ways. Black list those \"customers\" and they'll find a way to pay you back. Like Jesse said, they had the best product and no one else was dealing because Tuco was dead. \n\n2. After Jesse gets caught up in a situation that leads to a man's death, he starts getting cocky and pushes for them to expand. He tries to act like a know it all, pulling out a map and *teaching* Jesse, the one who is in charge of business, new areas to expand to. Jesse literally warns him that going into new territory will lead to violent encounters but Walt is happy to milk the MISBELIEF that Jesse killed Spooge even though he knows Jesse and his crew are no killers. At this point, they don't even have junior dealers working for Badger, Skinny Pete or Combo. \n\n3. Every single thing that Jesse warned Walt about happens. First, Badger gets arrested which costs them $80k to resolve. This also loses them a dealer. And then, disaster: Combo gets killed. Where? In new territory where Gus' dealers are. This means they're down two dealers and only have Skinny Pete. And he naturally wants out because Combo is dead. This also puts Jesse under tremendous stress which leads to him leaning heavily into drugs. Walt starts worrying about how they're going to sell 50 pounds of product, but he doesn't seem AT ALL worried about Jesse. He finagles a deal with a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy and manages to get a deal to sell all of his product to Gus. At this point, there's no doubt that Gus is most likely buying it just to get it off the market. \n\nThe entire reason they end up in business with Gus, the entire reason Combo was killed by Gus' dealers, the entire reason this whole business deal with Gus even starts is due to **WALT'S EGO**. His ego is also what led to them having their run-in with Tuco. Walt was angry about $1500-$2000 a day being too slow for him and wanted to sell to a distributor. Walt was angry about needing pseudo for a traditional cook so he concocted the plan to steal methylamine. Out of everyone, Gus and Walt are the only ones who didn't want to \"get out\" of the business. \n\nMike was a lot of things, and up until he finally warmed up to Jesse, he was a piece of shit in a lot of ways, but he wasn't in the business to be in the business. He was happy to get out ahead at various points in the series. Him and Jesse were willing to walk away, sell their shares of the methylamine and walk away with more money than they could've earned in a lifetime. But who wanted to stay? Walt. \n\nIt's easy to see Walt as the reasonable one who wanted to help Jesse. But it's important to understand that almost every time Walt \"saved\" Jesse, he was saving Jesse from a horrible situation that **he himself** put Jesse in.", "timestamp": 1763748525, "label": "0"}

I'm not really a huge tv person nor do I usually give into the hype of things but a few months ago I was looking up \"best television series of all time\" and of course Breaking Bad was consistently mentioned as being #1. I'm so happy I finally got around to watching the series, I'm just sad that I'm so late. The entire cast was phenomenal, every episode from the very first one pulled me into and kept me surprised, entertained and yet astonished at how beautifully it was shot.

{"original_topic": "breaking_bad", "comment": "Majority of the show happened in 1 year - and that's actually pretty realistic As most fans have figured that the majority of Breaking Bad happened in 2 years - with one year covering the first 4 seasons and first 3 episodes of season 5 and the remaining year was 13 episodes - some have said that this timeline is ridiculously unrealistic, but IMO it makes total sense, especially during binge watches. \n\nFrom my real life experiences, a lot can happen in one year, and sometimes 3-4 years and nothing changes besides that your best friend broke up with his girlfriend or your local Los Pollos joint gets shut down. It's all relative and based on perspectives. The same way people didn't know that the Beatles' discography only lasted about 7 years, because each album/image of the band was so different from one another.\n\n Breaking Bad happens to have a lot of events and multiple perspectives told through a lot of characters (who evolve a lot throughout the course of the series) with depths to them.

{"original_topic": "euphoria", "comment": "Euphoria really destroyed its potential Hey y\u2019all, so I was bored and decided to rewatch Euphoria, and dang guys season 1 is literally so peak. I really feel like Euphoria stands out from all these other high school dramas because the aesthetic and cinematography is just beautiful, not to mention that I also feel like the characters are super realistic (not so much the whole high school aspect because every one of these bitches would be dress coded in two seconds if it was the real world lol) but just the way the characters think and feel, I mean I\u2019m in college now but when season 1 first came out, I was a sophomore in high school and the characters were just so relatable to me.\n\nBut I\u2019m not gonna lie, Euphoria really just wasted away all of its potential with season 2 and how they\u2019re treating the release of season 3. First of all, season 2 was lowkey trash. There wasn\u2019t much in the way of character development or just overall storyline, and after rewatching season 2, it really just feels kind of dragged on. When the hype was going on for season 2, people treated this show like it could do no wrong and so did I, but now I really just feel like season 2 is pretty bad. Lexi\u2019s play was also so unnecessary, like I get that they were trying to show how she was coming out of her shell and stuff, but I feel like they could have done that in a much better way, we as the audience really didn\u2019t need a whole recap of the events of season 1 in a school play that would have never been allowed to exist in a real school. Outside of just the writing though, I mean these people have waited SO LONG to release the next season, it\u2019s gonna be 4 years by the time the new season comes out. I know there were unexpected deaths from the cast which is just a tragedy, but it\u2019s been so long and there\u2019s so many people missing in the show now that I feel like people aren\u2019t even excited about this show anymore, and they should lowkey just call it good, but of course they\u2019re gonna milk it financially for all that it\u2019s worth.

{"original_topic": "breaking_bad", "comment": "Daily reminder that neither Mike nor Walt were \"right\" or \"wrong\", they were both pretty terrible people I saw a post yesterday about how Mike was wrong in his argument against Walt about how they had a good thing and Walt blew it up. I actually don't disagree with everything said about Mike's \"points\". I agree with a lot of it. \n\nI think Gus had Tomas murdered or at least knew that's what the dealers would do. Think about it. Gus' big thing is that his people don't operate without his consent or knowledge. Gus liked these dealers so much, he risked his relationship with Walt to protect them. There's no way they did that without Gus having at least mild knowledge of it. I think it was a play to get Jesse killed. Jesse goes to retaliate, believing Walt wouldn't care or react or even know about it until Jesse had already gone to the dealers. They were already waiting for him, Jesse gets gunned down and Gus consoles Walt after having the dealers killed by Mike for killing Tomas and causing the situation to begin with. Now Gus has Walt, his perfect lab and no more \"junkie\". Walt knew this, he figured it out and literally told Gus that hypothetically Jesse might have believed it was Gus' doing. The show writers wouldn't have Walt say this unless they wanted us to think about it. \n\nBut does that make Walt the good guy? Or Mike? No. Mike wanted to kill Jesse for a long time. He wanted to kill Jesse just for doing drugs after his girlfriend died. Literally told Walt, \"Let me take care of it\" intending to kill Jesse at a drug house when he was consumed with grief. The same Mike that we're supposed to believe saw Jesse as a son. \n\nOn the flip side, Mike figured Walt out and knew exactly what kind of man Walt was. Walt isn't a saint. He kept Jesse alive for his own selfish reasons. He used Jesse, manipulated him, took advantage of him. And let's not forget... Walt caused Jane to turn over and choke and then stood there while she choked. Walt is also the reason they got mixed up with Gus to begin with. \n\nHere's the list of garbage moves Walt made that caused Jesse's life to get progressively worse at every turn: \n\n1. When they were making cash hand over fist, Walt freaked out about Skinny Pete getting mugged which is absolutely a thing that dealers have to deal with. This put Jesse in a compromising situation for a wad of cash that they could easily make back on the back end. No retaliation is bad for business? You can retaliate in other ways. Black list those \"customers\" and they'll find a way to pay you back. Like Jesse said, they had the best product and no one else was dealing because Tuco was dead. \n\n2. After Jesse gets caught up in a situation that leads to a man's death, he starts getting cocky and pushes for them to expand. He tries to act like a know it all, pulling out a map and *teaching* Jesse, the one who is in charge of business, new areas to expand to. Jesse literally warns him that going into new territory will lead to violent encounters but Walt is happy to milk the MISBELIEF that Jesse killed Spooge even though he knows Jesse and his crew are no killers. At this point, they don't even have junior dealers working for Badger, Skinny Pete or Combo. \n\n3. Every single thing that Jesse warned Walt about happens. First, Badger gets arrested which costs them $80k to resolve. This also loses them a dealer. And then, disaster: Combo gets killed. Where? In new territory where Gus' dealers are. This means they're down two dealers and only have Skinny Pete. And he naturally wants out because Combo is dead. This also puts Jesse under tremendous stress which leads to him leaning heavily into drugs. Walt starts worrying about how they're going to sell 50 pounds of product, but he doesn't seem AT ALL worried about Jesse. He finagles a deal with a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy and manages to get a deal to sell all of his product to Gus. At this point, there's no doubt that Gus is most likely buying it just to get it off the market. \n\nThe entire reason they end up in business with Gus, the entire reason Combo was killed by Gus' dealers, the entire reason this whole business deal with Gus even starts is due to **WALT'S EGO**. His ego is also what led to them having their run-in with Tuco. Walt was angry about $1500-$2000 a day being too slow for him and wanted to sell to a distributor. Walt was angry about needing pseudo for a traditional cook so he concocted the plan to steal methylamine. Out of everyone, Gus and Walt are the only ones who didn't want to \"get out\" of the business. \n\nMike was a lot of things, and up until he finally warmed up to Jesse, he was a piece of shit in a lot of ways, but he wasn't in the business to be in the business. He was happy to get out ahead at various points in the series. Him and Jesse were willing to walk away, sell their shares of the methylamine and walk away with more money than they could've earned in a lifetime. But who wanted to stay? Walt. \n\nIt's easy to see Walt as the reasonable one who wanted to help Jesse. But it's important to understand that almost every time Walt \"saved\" Jesse, he was saving Jesse from a horrible situation that **he himself** put Jesse in.", "timestamp": 1763748901, "label": "0"}

I\u2019ve been rewatching Breaking Bad and noticed how often characters openly discuss criminal details over the phone: deals, locations, threats, everything.\n\nGiven the scale of the investigation (DEA, Hank, cartel attention, etc.), wouldn\u2019t phone tapping or surveillance have been a standard procedure at some point? Even Hank or Gomez mentioned something about tapped phones. It feels like this should\u2019ve led to several characters getting caught much earlier.\n\nAm I missing something in the show\u2019s logic, or is this actually a plot hole?\n\nEven more, how the raid of Los Pollos Hermanos trucks didn\u2019t get attention from DEA?

{"original_topic": "breaking_bad", "comment": "Majority of the show happened in 1 year - and that's actually pretty realistic As most fans have figured that the majority of Breaking Bad happened in 2 years - with one year covering the first 4 seasons and first 3 episodes of season 5 and the remaining year was 13 episodes - some have said that this timeline is ridiculously unrealistic, but IMO it makes total sense, especially during binge watches. \n\nFrom my real life experiences, a lot can happen in one year, and sometimes 3-4 years and nothing changes besides that your best friend broke up with his girlfriend or your local Los Pollos joint gets shut down. It's all relative and based on perspectives. The same way people didn't know that the Beatles' discography only lasted about 7 years, because each album/image of the band was so different from one another.\n\n Breaking Bad happens to have a lot of events and multiple perspectives told through a lot of characters (who evolve a lot throughout the course of the series) with depths to them. That gives us the illusion that the show would be like 3-4 years in total.", "timestamp": 1763748902, "label": "1"}

He went from being a selfish, jealous bully to the best goddamn babysitter on the planet! Ever since he saw the Demogorgon at the Byers house in S1, he has become such a good guy. He is fiercely protective about those he cares about, especially the younger kids, who he often has to help protect as they go through with their VERY dangerous plans to combat the Upside Down.\n\nIn S4, he tells Nancy he's been thinking about what he wants his life to look like after this is all over. He's always dreamed of having a wife and 6 kids, packing them into an RV, and driving around the country to see the Grand Canyon and other great wonders of the world. He later admits to Nancy in the Upside Down that she is the wife he's been dreaming of. He has never fully gotten over her.\n\nWhile Nancy does care about Steve a lot, she has a boyfriend despite their issues and she only sees Steve as a close friend. You can tell by the look on her face she was hoping he wouldn't say that. And not only that, but Steve's dream sounds like a nightmare for someone as driven as Nancy. To have 6 kids at that point in time, Nancy would have to be a stay at home mom. And she seems like someone who would want her own career to feel fulfilled, like becoming a journalist.\n\nSomething many fans don't realize is that Steve's dream has already come true, just not in the way he had thought. He did in fact drive around in an RV with Nancy and 6 kids to prepare to go after Vecna. That sounds like an incredible setup for an absolutely devastating death.\n\nDo you think Steve will die? Will he sacrifice himself to save one of the kids or even Nancy herself? Is Steve dying the reason why Nancy is crying and washing blood off her hands in the S5 trailer? I know most fans would be heartbroken over this and I do not want it to happen, but it seems probable that it could happen.", "timestamp": 1763748910, "label": "1"}

Zero second of fillers and the storyline is just so packed and well paced. \n\nThe show had this perfect balance of mystery, horror, thrill and heart back then. Season 1 feels like lightning in a bottle. Small town, small cast and one central mission, find Will. The world hadn't exploded into ten different storylines yet, the tension stayed insane. \n\nThe scale being small did wonders. One missing kid. One group of boys. One grieving mom. One girl with powers. One shady lab. That\u2019s it. And somehow it felt massive because the stakes were so personal.\n\nNo matter how big the show gets, that first season is always going to feel like lightning in a bottle. It set the tone perfectly. And this is why Season 2 is my 2nd favourite Season, it had the essence of Season 1. \n\nSeason 2 is the closest the show ever got to recapturing that formula. It felt like Hawkins wasn\u2019t drowning in plot threads unlike the later seasons. The characters were dealing with the fallout of Season 1, everyone was still connected, the tone stayed grounded, and Will\u2019s possession arc was just so damn strong.", "timestamp": 1763748912, "label": "1"}

For a while now, I\u2019ve noticed that a boy in my class behaves in a certain way towards me, and I\u2019m not sure how to interpret it. Here are the facts:\n\n1. **At the beginning of the school year**, he often tried to make eye contact with me. I\u2019m very shy, so I avoided it. Then, he started calling me *Baka* (a Japanese word for \"idiot\") discreetly, but I could clearly hear him.\n2. **As time went on, his behavior changed**. During a school trip, on the bus, he suddenly said: *\"Wesh \\[my name\\], how are you!?\"* Then, he kept looking at me. Every time I looked at him, he would look away, and when I turned back to the window, he would look at me again. This went on for a while until I got too embarrassed and turned completely away.\n3. **One day in class**, I was talking to his little sister (we\u2019ve become friends) a bit away from the group. When we decided to rejoin the others, he suddenly rushed towards my friend, stopped abruptly when he saw me, and then went back to his friends.\n4. **His little sister told me things about him**. She said he talked about me at home, saying that at the beginning of the year, he had certain thoughts about me, but now it\u2019s better. He also said that I was nice and that I didn\u2019t talk to boys, which made me a \"good Muslim.\" He asked her not to tell me, but of course, she did.\n5. **One day, he asked if I was Moroccan**. I replied a bit curtly (I regret it). My friend later told me that before I arrived, he was talking to his friend about wanting to focus on his projects, but as soon as I walked in, he asked me that question.\n6. **Recently, while I was handing out papers in class**, he suddenly turned towards me and whispered something to his friend.\n7. **Another time, he asked me:** *\"Are you going to defend me at the class council?\"* (I\u2019m just an eco-delegate and not involved in the class council). Right after asking, he left without waiting for an answer.\n\nI\u2019m confused. He seems comfortable talking to other girls, but with me, he acts distant and ambiguous. Do you think he might be interested in me, or am I reading too much into this? How should I react?\n\nThank you in advance for your advice!\n\nAsk me questions if some points are not clear :)", "timestamp": 1763748913, "label": "0"}

{"original_topic": "wednesday", "comment": "I really wish Tyler and the other Hydes were written more like actual Jekyll-and-Hyde monsters Basically, exactly what the title says. A lot of the writing in this show is\u2026 let\u2019s call it \u201cwonky,\u201d and the show's lore suffers from it. The Alpha werewolf lore feels like it was made up in 5 minutes, and the Hyde lore isn\u2019t much better. The show dedicated two seasons to Hydes, and it still feels all over the place.\n\nHydes are clearly inspired by Robert Louis Stevenson's novella *The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde*. In the novella, Dr. Henry Jekyll develops a potion to separate his good and evil sides. When he drinks it, he transforms into evil Edward Hyde. Over time, Jekyll's transformations become more frequent and involuntary. The novella ends with Jekyll's final, unchangeable transformation into Hyde, who then commits suicide.\u00a0Throughout the story, Jekyll remembers everything he does as Hyde. Hyde is not a separate personality that takes over Jekyll's consciousness; rather, Hyde is Jekyll acting without his usual inhibitions, and Jekyll is fully aware of Hyde's actions. Essentially,\u00a0Jekyll tries to use the transformation to indulge in his darker impulses.\n\nThat\u2019s a very cool concept. And in Season 1, it seemed like the show was going in that direction. Tyler\u2019s first transformations are triggered by Laurel\u2019s chemicals. Maybe not at first, but over time, he becomes fully aware of his actions as a Hyde and starts enjoying them, because they give him the freedom to act on impulses he normally suppresses. That tracks with the original novella. But then the show adds lore that honestly makes everything messier: the **\u201cmaster\u201d**.\n\nAt first, I get it; writers needed a way to justify Laurel controlling Tyler and tie the twist together. Fine. But Season 2 introduces Tyler\u2019s mother, and suddenly the whole \u201cmaster\u201d concept becomes a narrative roadblock. So now apparently female Hydes don\u2019t need a master, only male Hydes do. BUT the master\u2019s control seems optional because Tyler kills Laurel and fights his own mother, AND male Hydes supposedly go \u201cinsane\u201d without a master, AND they still die young because each transformation shortens their lifespan. It really sucks being a male hyena. I mean Hyde.\n\nSo\u2026 what does a \u201cmaster\u201d even mean anymore?\n\nIt just feels *messy.* I wish they had stuck closer to the original Jekyll-and-Hyde idea rather than constantly adding plot-convenient rules that contradict earlier ones. And it\u2019s not just Hydes. The Alpha werewolf lore is equally vague and inconsistent.\n\nSeason 3 is going to expand the Hyde/werewolf lore even more with Capri and her mix of Hydes and werewolves, and honestly? I\u2019m scared that by the end of it, things are going to be even more convoluted than they already are, when they really don\u2019t need to be.\n\nAlso, as I was finishing typing all of this, I remembered that in Season 1, Xavier had some weird psychic connection to Tyler/Hyde, which the show never explained. But I guess we\u2019re never going to learn how or why that worked. Oh well\u2026\n\nJust some of my thoughts. What do you guys think about Hydes and how the show handles their lore?", "timestamp": 1763748918, "label": "1"}

{"original_topic": "wednesday", "comment": "Why Wenclair Doesn\u2019t Click for Me Anymore- as a huge fan of the ship after s1 I\u2019ve been trying really hard to figure out why Wenclair doesn\u2019t hit for me anymore, especially because I *want* to love them the way I did back in season one. I genuinely enjoyed their dynamic at first. Their contrast felt natural, their growth felt earned, and the whole \u201cOpessites attract\u201d trope actually worked really well. They had softness, tension, vulnerability, and all these tiny moments that made their connection feel warm and meaningful. I really believed in the version of them that season one was building.\n\nBut after S1, something changed for me, and it\u2019s been harder than I expected to reconnect with the ship. In season two, the relationship that hooked me just\u2026 wasn\u2019t there in the same way. They spent a lot of their scenes either arguing, miscommunicating, or being emotionally out of sync, and I never felt like the show gave them the time to rebuild or deepen the connection they started with. Even when they *did* have an emotional moment, like right before switching their bodies back, it didn\u2019t carry that same spark or weight from S1. It felt more like a leftover of what they used to be rather than a continuation of what they could\u2019ve become.\n\nI\u2019m not saying the writing was malicious or that the characters stopped caring about each other, but the shift in their dynamic made it harder for me to see the romantic potential that used to stand out so clearly. Instead of growing closer, it felt like they drifted apart, and the emotional thread between them got thinner instead of stronger. And when a ship relies heavily on chemistry, softness, and contrast, that shift really affects how you connect with it.\n\nI also want to be clear: this isn\u2019t an attack on Wenclair or the people who love it. I completely understand why the ship is meaningful to so many fans, and I think the version of Wenclair in season one was genuinely compelling. I\u2019m not trying to take that away from anyone. I\u2019m just being honest about my own experience: after S1, the show didn\u2019t give me the same feeling or energy that originally made me see their relationship in a romantic light.\n\nThe frustrating part is that I *wish* I still shipped it. I wish I could recapture that spark I felt the first time around. I wish I could go back to seeing what everyone else still sees. But the shift in how they were written in S2 changed the way I interpreted their dynamic, and no matter how much I try to get that old feeling back, I can\u2019t force it.\n\nSo this isn\u2019t a hate post, or a dismissal, or some superiority compex thing. It\u2019s just me admitting that the version of Wenclair I connected to isn\u2019t really present anymore, at least not for me. And I really wish that wasn\u2019t the case.", "timestamp": 1763748920, "label": "1"}
